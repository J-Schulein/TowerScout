# TowerScout

TowerScout is a tool for identifying cooling towers from satellite and aerial imagery.  Cooling towers are potential sources of _Legionella_ bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' disease.  TowerScout has been utilized in over 12 investigations of outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease across 8 states since 2021.  It can be used after outbreaks to identify potential sources of _Legionella_, and it can be used before outbreaks to build and update a registry of cooling towers to aid future investigations.  

## About TowerScout 

The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://cdc.gov) have [procedures](https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/environmental-inv-resources/id-cooling-towers.html) for identifying cooling towers during investigation of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease, which can be significantly sped up by using TowerScout.  TowerScout has been used in more than 12 investigations of outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease across 8 states since 2021.  In 2021, TowerScout was the [Hal Varian Award Winner](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mids/capstone/varianaward) for the [Master of Information and Data Science Program (MIDS)](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/programs/mids) in the [School of Information](https://ischool.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](https://berkeley.edu).  

TowerScout has been used by local health departments:
- The the Utah Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) used TowerScout for [detecting cooling towers](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2023-07-04-cooling-tower-update/) in aerial imagery.
- The Los Angeles County Enterprise GIS (eGIS) team and Department of Public Health used TowerScout to build an initial dataset of likely cooling tower locations across the County.  The work was the [2023 NACo Achievement Award Winner, Information Technology (Best in Category)](https://www.naco.org/resources/award-programs/towerscout-adaptation-%E2%80%93-automated-image-analysis-identify-cooling-towers).

## Features

### Automated Detection
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: YOLOv5 object detection + EfficientNet classification
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Google Maps and Azure Maps satellite imagery
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently process large geographic areas tile-by-tile
- **Confidence Scoring**: Adjustable thresholds for detection sensitivity

### Manual Tower Addition
- **Interactive Drawing**: Add cooling towers manually via polygon drawing tool
- **Visual Distinction**: Manual towers display with purple borders and "✋ Manual" badges
- **Automatic Geocoding**: Addresses automatically retrieved and cached for performance
- **Dataset Integration**: Manual towers included in all export formats (CSV, KML, YOLO)
- **Dataset Restoration**: Import/export datasets to preserve manual towers across sessions
- **Provider Lock**: Prevents imagery mismatch by locking provider selection after detections

### Export & Analysis
- **CSV Export**: Detection lists with addresses, confidence scores, and coordinates for epidemiological tracking
- **KML Export**: Google Earth compatible files for geographic visualization
- **YOLO Format**: Training dataset exports with normalized coordinates for ML model improvement
- **Flexible Filtering**: Export subsets based on confidence thresholds or manual selection

### Search & Navigation
- **Address Search**: Find locations by street address, city, or neighborhood
- **Zipcode Search**: Define search areas by postal code boundaries
- **Custom Polygons**: Draw complex search areas with interactive polygon tool
- **Circular Search**: Radius-based search around specific coordinates
- **Tile Estimation**: Preview processing time before running detection (~100 tiles ≈ 30 seconds)

### Data Validation
- **Interactive Review**: Click towers in list to highlight on map (bidirectional)
- **False Positive Removal**: Uncheck detections to exclude from exports
- **Tile-by-Tile Review**: Systematic review mode for accuracy verification
- **Cross-Provider Validation**: Compare detections across different imagery sources
