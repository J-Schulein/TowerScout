# TowerScout OCI Quick Start

This guide covers the v1 local container package shape for TowerScout. It is engine-aware: the same Compose files are intended to work with a validated Docker or Podman host, but Podman support must still pass the Windows compatibility spike before release docs promise it as the supported user runtime.

## Supported V1 Target

- Windows 11 on AMD64
- Single-user local use
- CPU baseline
- Normal outbound internet access for map providers and asset/bootstrap workflows
- Docker-compatible or OCI-compatible container engine with Compose support

Out of scope for v1: Mac, ARM64, air-gapped/offline installs, VDI, shared multi-user hosting, native installer behavior, and managed remote deployment.

## Package Contents

The release package is expected to include:

- `compose.yaml`
- `.env.example`
- `scripts/start.cmd` / `scripts/start.ps1`
- `scripts/stop.cmd` / `scripts/stop.ps1`
- `scripts/logs.cmd` / `scripts/logs.ps1`
- `scripts/status.cmd` / `scripts/status.ps1`
- `scripts/import-assets.cmd` / `scripts/import-assets.ps1`
- `scripts/import-tls-ca.cmd` / `scripts/import-tls-ca.ps1`
- `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`
- `IMAGE.txt`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- quick-start and runtime-contract documentation
- a pinned GHCR image reference by digest

Large model and ZIP-code assets are not stored in git and are not expected to be baked into the default source checkout.

## Creating A Release Package

Release maintainers can assemble the control package from a source checkout:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-release.cmd -Version v0.1.0 -Image ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout -ImageDigest sha256:<digest>
```

This creates `dist\towerscout-v0.1.0\`, `dist\towerscout-v0.1.0.zip`, and `dist\towerscout-v0.1.0.zip.sha256`. The package includes `IMAGE.txt` for the release image reference and `SHA256SUMS.txt` for the files inside the package.

If `-ImageDigest` is omitted, the package is suitable for local validation only. Release packages should pin `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE` to an immutable digest reference.

## Publishing The GHCR Image

The manual GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/container-publish.yml` publishes the Linux/AMD64 image to:

```text
ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout
```

Run the workflow manually with a release tag such as `v0.1.0-rc1`. The workflow summary reports the immutable digest reference:

```text
ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout@sha256:<digest>
```

Use that digest reference when generating the release package.

## First Run

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the package directory.
2. Set `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE` to the release image reference provided with the GitHub Release. Release packages should use a pinned digest.
3. Start TowerScout:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.cmd
```

4. Open `http://localhost:5000`.
5. Use the Setup Wizard to configure Google Maps or Azure Maps.

Provider keys are normally saved through Setup Wizard or Settings into the persistent `towerscout_config` volume. Do not put provider secrets in `.env` unless a site-specific support procedure requires it.

## Local Developer Build

For developer/support use from a source checkout:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.cmd -Build
```

This uses `compose.build.yaml` and builds `towerscout:local` from the local Dockerfile.

## Engine Selection

Scripts auto-detect the engine. To force one:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.cmd -Engine docker
.\scripts\status.cmd -Engine podman
```

Docker Desktop use depends on license, procurement, endpoint policy, and local installation approval. Podman is the preferred open-source runtime target only after the compatibility spike validates the Windows host path.

On Windows, `podman compose` is a wrapper around an external Compose provider such as `docker-compose` or `podman-compose`. The TowerScout scripts call `podman compose` for the Podman path, but release validation must confirm the target workstation has a working Compose provider that can talk to the Podman machine.

Two Podman checks are required before promising Podman as the normal user runtime:

1. Docker Desktop engine stopped, with Podman machine running, to confirm the Podman path does not depend on the Docker daemon.
2. Docker-Desktop-free Compose provider validation, such as `podman-compose` or another approved provider, to confirm the package can work without Docker Desktop installed.

## Status And Logs

```powershell
.\scripts\status.cmd
.\scripts\logs.cmd
.\scripts\logs.cmd -Follow
```

`status.ps1` calls Compose `ps` and then polls `/api/readiness`. A `fatal` readiness state returns a nonzero exit code.

## TLS Inspection

If provider key validation fails with "Could not reach the provider validation service" while the container logs show `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`, the container does not trust the certificate authority used by the local network, proxy, or endpoint inspection tool.

Preferred fix: import the local root/intermediate CA into the persistent config volume and use a combined bundle that keeps the container's normal Debian CA roots:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-tls-ca.cmd -Thumbprint <windows-certificate-thumbprint>
```

The helper can also import an exported PEM/CER/CRT file:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-tls-ca.cmd -CertificatePath C:\path\to\local-ca.pem
```

After import, set both variables in `.env` and recreate the container:

```powershell
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem
SSL_CERT_FILE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem
.\scripts\start.cmd
```

The helper verifies Google TLS with an invalid test key. A successful TLS fix returns a normal provider invalid-key response instead of a certificate verification error.

Last-resort validation-only workaround:

```powershell
TOWERSCOUT_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1
```

Do not use the insecure setting as the normal release configuration.

## Persistent Data

The default profile uses named volumes:

- `towerscout_config`: provider config and generated `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
- `towerscout_model_params`: model weights
- `towerscout_data`: ZIP-code shapefile data
- `towerscout_logs`: app and performance logs
- `towerscout_flask_session`: filesystem sessions
- `towerscout_session_temp`: detection/export/restore working files
- `towerscout_uploads`: uploads and optional debug images
- `towerscout_cache`: map and geocoding cache

These volumes can contain provider keys, addresses, coordinates, uploaded files, logs, cached provider responses, and investigation data. Treat them as sensitive local data.

## Assets

TowerScout readiness reports missing or corrupt required assets as `degraded`. Import or bootstrap assets into the named volumes according to the release asset instructions, then restart TowerScout.

For a GitHub Release package, place the asset bundle next to the scripts with this layout:

```text
assets/
  model_params/
    yolov5/
    EN/
  data/
    tl_2025_us_zcta520/
```

Then import and verify it:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source assets
```

For release-candidate or support validation, enable SHA-256 verification during import:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source assets -VerifyHashes
```

For a source checkout that already has local assets under `webapp/`, use:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source webapp -Engine docker -Build -VerifyHashes
```

Release-candidate validation should enable SHA-256 checks:

```powershell
$env:TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES = "1"
.\scripts\status.cmd
```

Routine CI and first-run setup should not hash large assets on every readiness poll.

## Stop

```powershell
.\scripts\stop.cmd
```

This stops the container but keeps named volumes intact.
