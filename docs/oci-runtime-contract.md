# TowerScout OCI Runtime Contract

This document summarizes the v1 container runtime contract. The detailed task evidence lives under `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-025/`.

## Runtime Shape

- Application process: `python towerscout.py`
- HTTP port: `5000`
- Server: Waitress
- Health: `GET /api/health`
- Readiness: `GET /api/readiness`
- Default container startup: `TOWERSCOUT_STARTUP_PRELOAD=0` and `TOWERSCOUT_LAZY_MODEL_INIT=1`
- YOLO/Ultralytics config directory: `YOLO_CONFIG_DIR=/app/webapp/cache/ultralytics`

The container startup defaults allow TowerScout to serve setup and readiness responses before large runtime assets are present. Readiness reports missing assets instead of hiding them behind startup failure.

## Readiness States

- `setup_required`: app is usable, but provider setup is incomplete
- `degraded`: app is usable, but recoverable runtime capability is missing, such as required assets
- `ready`: provider config and required assets are present
- `fatal`: app cannot safely serve normal or recovery workflows

`/api/readiness` returns HTTP 503 only for `fatal`. Other states return HTTP 200 with machine-readable JSON.

## Required Writable Paths

The default Compose profile maps each path to a named volume:

| Container path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/app/webapp/config` | `.env`, backups, generated `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` |
| `/app/webapp/model_params` | YOLO and EfficientNet model assets |
| `/app/webapp/data` | ZIP-code shapefile assets |
| `/app/webapp/logs` | app, error, and performance logs |
| `/app/webapp/flask_session` | Flask-Session files |
| `/app/webapp/temp/session` | detection/export/restore working state |
| `/app/webapp/uploads` | uploads and optional debug images |
| `/app/webapp/cache` | map and geocoding caches |

## Secret Key Contract

If `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is absent on startup, TowerScout generates a secure value and persists it to `/app/webapp/config/.env`. The value must survive container restart/recreate through the mounted config volume and must not be exposed through config status, readiness, logs, or UI.

## Asset Contract

Tracked manifest: `/app/webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`

Default release import layout:

```text
assets/model_params/
assets/data/
```

Windows import helper:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source assets -VerifyHashes
```

Readiness checks:

- manifest is present and valid
- required asset files exist
- expected byte sizes match

SHA-256 verification is available with `TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES=1` for release validation and support diagnostics.

## Release Package Contract

The GitHub Release control package is assembled by `scripts/package-release.cmd` / `scripts/package-release.ps1`. It contains:

- Compose runtime configuration
- `.env.example` with the selected image reference
- Windows `.cmd` wrappers and PowerShell helpers for start, stop, logs, status, asset import, and TLS CA import
- this runtime contract and the quick start
- `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`
- `IMAGE.txt`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- a top-level ZIP checksum beside the package ZIP

Normal release packages should set `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE` to an immutable registry digest reference such as `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout@sha256:<digest>`. Packages without an image digest are for local validation or developer/support use only.

Current repository package target: `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout`.

Image publication is handled by the manual GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/container-publish.yml`. The workflow requires `packages: write`, pushes a Linux/AMD64 image, uploads `image-metadata.json`, and reports the digest reference in the workflow summary.

## Upload Limit

`TOWERSCOUT_MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` remains the single request-body/upload-size knob. Model upload remains disabled unless `TOWERSCOUT_ENABLE_MODEL_UPLOAD` is explicitly truthy.

## TLS Trust

Provider-key validation and provider API calls should verify TLS by default. Container deployments behind TLS-inspecting proxies or endpoint tools may need to provide a local CA bundle through the persistent config volume and set `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` / `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the in-container PEM path.

`scripts/import-tls-ca.cmd` can export a Windows certificate-store entry by thumbprint, include its Windows chain, copy it into `/app/webapp/config/certs/`, and build `/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem` by appending the imported CA material to the container's default Debian CA bundle. The release `.env` should then point both `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` at that combined bundle path.

`TOWERSCOUT_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1` exists only as a local validation fallback for provider-key checks and should not be used as the normal release posture.

## Validation Split

Routine CI should prove image build, asset-light startup, health/readiness, and persistent config/secret behavior without provider credentials or large assets.

Release-candidate validation should add real asset import, SHA-256 verification, setup/settings persistence across restart, and the maintained detection smoke path.

## Podman Compatibility Boundary

The engine-aware scripts support `-Engine podman` through `podman compose`. On Windows, `podman compose` delegates Compose behavior to an external provider such as Docker Compose or `podman-compose` while wiring that provider to the Podman socket.

The current local spike validated the Podman WSL engine path, named volumes, asset import, readiness, and containerized smoke behavior. It did not prove either of these release gates:

1. Podman Compose while the Docker Desktop engine is stopped, to confirm the Podman path does not depend on the Docker daemon.
2. Podman Compose with a Docker-Desktop-free provider such as `podman-compose`, to confirm the package can run without Docker Desktop installed.

Release qualification for Podman should include the selected Compose provider explicitly.
