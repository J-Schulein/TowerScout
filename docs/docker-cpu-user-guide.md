# TowerScout Docker CPU User Guide

**Applies to**: Current V1 release-candidate package path after RC6
packaging, unless release notes say otherwise
**Last reviewed**: 2026-06-24
**Audience**: Windows users assigned the Docker Desktop CPU path
**Runtime scope**: Docker Desktop, CPU Application Package, CPU launch mode

Use this guide when support tells you to run TowerScout with Docker Desktop
without GPU acceleration. This is the normal package path for most users.

## Before You Start

Install or confirm these items before running TowerScout.

- Windows 11 on AMD64.
- Windows PowerShell. Use PowerShell from Windows, not a WSL or Ubuntu
  terminal.
- A modern browser such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
- Normal outbound internet access to GitHub Releases, GHCR, and the selected
  map provider.
- At least `15 GB` free disk space. `25 GB` is a better first-setup target.
- One approved Google Maps or Azure Maps provider key.
- Windows Subsystem for Linux 2.
  - Install guide:
    `https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command`
  - Note: Admin rights and/or helpdesk support may be required to install this
    software. Check with your local IT support if you encounter problems
    installing this software.
- Docker Desktop.
  - Download page: `https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/`
  - Note: Docker Desktop is free to download. A Docker account is not required
    to run the TowerScout local package, but local license, procurement, and
    endpoint-management rules still apply.

Docker Desktop must be installed, open, and running before entering the
`.\setup-towerscout.cmd` command.

Useful checks from PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl --status
wsl --list --verbose
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Expected result: WSL is installed, any listed Linux distribution uses version
`2`, Docker Desktop is running, and both Docker commands print version
information.

## Install TowerScout

1. Create a new working folder, for example:

   ```text
   C:\Users\<you>\Documents\TowerScout
   ```

2. Open the TowerScout GitHub Releases page and use the exact release that
   support selected:

   ```text
   https://github.com/J-Schulein/TowerScout/releases
   ```

3. Download these four files from the release `Assets` section into the new
   TowerScout folder:

   ```text
   towerscout-<release-version>-cpu.zip
   towerscout-<release-version>-cpu.zip.sha256
   towerscout-<release-version>-assets-<asset-version>.zip
   towerscout-<release-version>-assets-<asset-version>.zip.sha256
   ```

   Do not use GitHub's automatic source-code ZIP or the green `Code` button.

4. Extract only the CPU Application Package ZIP:

   ```text
   towerscout-<release-version>-cpu.zip
   ```

   Leave the Model & Data Package ZIP and both `.sha256` files beside the
   extracted folder. Do not extract the assets ZIP for the normal setup path.

5. Open the extracted application folder in File Explorer. It should contain
   `setup-towerscout.cmd`, `start.bat`, `scripts\`, `docs\`, and `assets\`.

6. In Windows File Explorer, click the address bar, type `powershell`, and
   press Enter.

7. In the PowerShell window, run:

   ```powershell
   .\setup-towerscout.cmd -Engine docker -Gpu off
   ```

8. Keep the PowerShell window open while Docker Desktop downloads and starts
   the TowerScout image. The first image pull can take several minutes.

9. When TowerScout opens in the browser, use Setup Wizard or Settings to
   configure one approved provider key. One valid Google Maps or Azure Maps key
   is enough to start.

Setup verifies the package checksum sidecars, imports the Model & Data Package
into Docker named volumes, starts TowerScout, and opens:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

`setup_required` is normal before provider setup is complete. After assets and
one provider key are configured, status should become `ready`.

## Stop, Restart, Status, And Logs

Run these commands from the extracted TowerScout application folder.

Stop TowerScout:

```powershell
.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine docker
```

Start again after setup:

```powershell
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

Restart:

```powershell
.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine docker
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

Check status:

```powershell
.\scripts\status.cmd -Engine docker
```

Show recent logs if support asks:

```powershell
.\scripts\logs.cmd -Engine docker -Tail 200
```

Use the same `-Engine docker` value on setup, start, stop, status, logs, asset
import, and TLS commands. Docker and Podman use separate storage.

## Troubleshooting

If setup cannot find Docker, open Docker Desktop from the Windows Start menu and
wait until it says the engine is running. Then rerun:

```powershell
docker --version
docker compose version
```

If the browser does not open, leave PowerShell open and manually open:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

If setup reports multiple asset ZIPs, move old TowerScout ZIPs out of the
working folder and rerun setup.

If status is `degraded`, required assets may be missing or corrupt. Ask support
before manually importing assets. A support-directed import command is:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Engine docker -Source assets -VerifyHashes -RestartWaitSeconds 180
```

If status is `fatal`, stop validation and send support the release version,
package filename, `IMAGE.txt`, status output, and a reviewed summary of recent
logs. Do not send provider secrets, `.env`, raw screenshots, browser network
traces, exported datasets, or unreviewed raw logs unless your site has an
approved handling procedure.

### Google Maps TLS Inspection CA

Use this only when Google Maps key validation fails even though the key is
correct and support sees `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` in container logs. This
usually means the container does not trust a local TLS inspection root or
intermediate certificate.

Run the guided dry run from the extracted TowerScout application folder:

```powershell
.\scripts\repair-provider-tls.cmd -Provider google -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

Review the local support-sensitive output with support. Do not paste
certificate subjects, issuer details, or thumbprints into public issue comments
or public release evidence. If the helper identifies a safe CA candidate, it
prints the exact apply command. With support approval, apply the repair and
restart TowerScout:

```powershell
.\scripts\repair-provider-tls.cmd -Provider google -Engine docker -Gpu off -Apply
.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine docker
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

If support already knows the correct Windows certificate thumbprint or has an
exported CA file, they can bypass automatic selection:

```powershell
.\scripts\repair-provider-tls.cmd -Provider google -Engine docker -Gpu off -Thumbprint <windows-certificate-thumbprint> -Apply
.\scripts\repair-provider-tls.cmd -Provider google -Engine docker -Gpu off -CertificatePath C:\path\to\local-ca.pem -Apply
.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine docker
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

Do not paste the placeholder text. Replace it with the actual support-provided
thumbprint or certificate path. The helper copies the CA chain into Docker's
persistent TowerScout config volume, builds a combined CA bundle, updates
`.env`, and verifies that Google TLS reaches the normal invalid-key response
instead of a certificate error.

If your site uses Azure Maps instead of Google Maps for validation, support may
use `-Provider azure`. If automatic discovery is ambiguous or unavailable,
support may still use the lower-level `scripts\import-tls-ca.cmd` command with a
known `-Thumbprint` or `-CertificatePath`.
