# TowerScout V1 RC1 Quick Start

This is the short Windows pilot path for the TowerScout V1 RC1 `agpl-yolo`
release package. It assumes a Windows 11 AMD64 workstation, Docker Desktop as
the primary pilot engine, normal outbound internet access, and one approved
Google Maps or Azure Maps provider key.

For detailed support guidance, see `docs/v1-rc1-package-guide.md`.

## Before You Start

Install or confirm these prerequisites before opening the TowerScout package.
If your workstation is managed by IT, ask your site administrator before
installing WSL, Docker Desktop, Podman, or provider credentials.

- Windows 11 on AMD64.
- Windows PowerShell. This is included with Windows.
- A modern browser such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
- WSL 2 and hardware virtualization support for Docker Desktop's normal Windows
  Linux-container backend. Docker's current Windows requirements include WSL
  `2.1.5` or later, virtualization enabled in BIOS/UEFI, and at least 8 GB RAM.
- Normal outbound internet access so the container engine can pull the pinned
  TowerScout image from GHCR and TowerScout can reach the selected map provider.
- Enough local disk space for the control package, asset bundle, container
  image, and Docker or Podman volumes. Plan for several GB; CUDA-capable images
  use substantially more space than CPU-only images.
- One container engine, selected as follows:
  - Docker Desktop is the primary V1 RC1 pilot path. During Docker Desktop
    installation, keep the WSL 2 backend selected when prompted, start Docker
    Desktop from the Windows Start menu, and wait until Docker Desktop reports
    that it is running.
  - Podman is a qualified package-runtime option only when support tells you to
    use it and the workstation already has a running Podman machine plus a
    working Compose provider such as `podman-compose`.
- One valid site/user-owned Google Maps or Azure Maps provider key.

You do not need Git, Python, Conda, Node.js, VS Code, or a source-code checkout
for the normal V1 RC1 package path.

If Docker Desktop is not already installed and approved on your workstation, or
if you do not already have a valid restricted provider key, stop here and
contact your site administrator or support lead before continuing.

If both Docker and Podman are installed, the launcher's automatic engine
selection can choose Docker first. If support or local policy tells you to use
Podman, pass `-Engine podman` on every helper command.

### If Docker Desktop Or WSL 2 Is Not Ready

If support asks you to check WSL 2, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --status
wsl --list --verbose
```

Expected result: WSL is installed, and any listed Linux distribution uses
version `2`. If WSL is not installed and your site allows you to install it,
Microsoft's current install path is:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

Restart the computer after installation if Windows asks. The first Linux
distribution launch may ask you to create a Linux username and password; that
is normal WSL setup and is separate from your Windows password.

After Docker Desktop is installed, open Docker Desktop from the Start menu. In
Docker Desktop Settings, the WSL 2 based engine should be selected when the
option is visible. Then open a normal PowerShell window and run:

```powershell
docker --version
docker compose version
```

Expected result: both commands print version information. If either command is
not recognized or says Docker is not running, keep Docker Desktop open and ask
support before continuing.

### How To Run The Commands In This Guide

Use Windows PowerShell, not the WSL/Ubuntu terminal, for the package commands.

To open PowerShell in a folder:

1. Open File Explorer.
2. Open the folder that contains the downloaded release files or extracted
   TowerScout package.
3. Click the address bar at the top of File Explorer.
4. Type `powershell` and press Enter.

Expected result: a blue or black PowerShell window opens, and the prompt shows
the folder path. Copy one command at a time from this guide, paste it into
PowerShell, and press Enter. Commands that start with `.\` run a script from
the current folder.

## 1. Download The Release Files

Download or receive the control ZIP and asset ZIP for the same release version:

- `towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1.zip`
- `towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1.zip.sha256`
- `towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1-assets-<asset-version>.zip`
- `towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1-assets-<asset-version>.zip.sha256`

The exact asset filename can change by release. The control package, asset
bundle, `IMAGE.txt`, `release-manifest.v1.json`, and `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`
must describe the same release handoff.

## 2. Verify The Downloads Before Extracting

In PowerShell, compare each downloaded ZIP to its matching `.sha256` file before
extracting either package:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1.zip -Algorithm SHA256
Get-Content .\towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1.zip.sha256
Get-FileHash .\towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1-assets-*.zip -Algorithm SHA256
Get-Content .\towerscout-v0.1.0-rc1-assets-*.zip.sha256
```

The `Hash` value from `Get-FileHash` must match the SHA-256 value in the
corresponding `.sha256` file. If either value does not match, stop and obtain a
fresh copy of the release artifact before continuing.

## 3. Extract The Control Package

Extract the control ZIP to a normal local folder such as:

```text
C:\Users\<you>\TowerScout-v0.1.0-rc1
```

After extraction, the folder should contain `start.bat`, `compose.yaml`,
`compose.gpu.yaml`, `scripts\`, `docs\`, compliance files, `IMAGE.txt`,
`SHA256SUMS.txt`, and an empty `assets\` folder.

## 4. Initialize The Package

From PowerShell in the package folder, run:

```powershell
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

The first launcher run creates `.env` from `.env.example`, starts the selected
container engine, polls TowerScout readiness, and opens:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

Readiness may be `setup_required` because provider setup is not complete,
`degraded` because assets are not imported yet, or both through recovery hints.
That is expected during first setup.

Expected result: PowerShell prints `Starting TowerScout with docker`, then a
readiness state. A browser window should open to TowerScout. If it does not
open, leave PowerShell open and manually open `http://localhost:5000`.

If support tells you to use a specific engine, keep using the same `-Engine`
value for every helper command because Docker and Podman use separate named
volumes:

```powershell
.\start.bat -Engine podman
```

If the launcher cannot find or start a container engine, confirm the selected
engine is installed and running before continuing. For Podman, confirm the
Podman machine is started. For Docker, confirm Docker Desktop is running.

## 5. Stage And Import Assets

Open the asset ZIP. Its root should contain:

```text
model_params\
data\
asset_manifest.v1.json
```

Extract those entries into the package `assets\` folder so the result is:

```text
assets\
  model_params\
  data\
  asset_manifest.v1.json
```

From PowerShell in the package folder, import the assets:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Engine docker -Source assets -VerifyHashes -RestartWaitSeconds 180
```

If you started with an explicit engine, use that same engine here:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Engine podman -Source assets
```

If you started TowerScout on a non-default port, use that same `-Port` value
when importing assets so the helper recreates the Compose service with the same
port binding:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Engine docker -Source assets -Port 5001 -RestartWaitSeconds 180
```

For release-candidate or support validation, verify hashes during import:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Engine docker -Source assets -VerifyHashes -RestartWaitSeconds 180
```

Or, with an explicit engine:

```powershell
.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Engine podman -Source assets -VerifyHashes
```

The import helper uses the selected engine's named volumes. It should run after
`.env` has been created by the launcher. After copying assets, the helper
restarts TowerScout so the running application discovers the imported model
files before the first detection run.

Expected result: the command finishes without missing or corrupt asset errors,
then waits for TowerScout to respond after restart. If hash verification fails,
stop and ask support for the correct asset bundle.

## 6. Start Or Reopen TowerScout

From the package folder, run:

```powershell
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

The default launch path is CPU-safe. It sets `TOWERSCOUT_DEVICE=cpu` for the
launch and does not request GPU devices.

Use `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1`, for normal browser use:

```text
http://localhost:5000
```

## 7. Optional GPU Launch

GPU launch is optional and Docker-first. Do not use it as the normal first-run
path unless support is validating a workstation with NVIDIA Docker GPU access.

CPU-safe default:

```powershell
.\start.bat -Gpu off
```

Optional Docker GPU modes:

```powershell
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu auto
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu on
```

- `-Gpu off` forces CPU execution.
- `-Gpu auto` uses CPU fallback unless `TOWERSCOUT_GPU_AUTO_OVERLAY=1` has been
  set after workstation-specific Docker GPU validation.
- `-Gpu on` requests the Docker GPU overlay and fails readiness if CUDA is not
  available to the container.

Podman GPU launch is not validated for V1 RC1. Use the CPU-safe Podman launch
unless support provides a site-specific GPU procedure.

## 8. Complete Setup

When the browser opens, use Setup Wizard or Settings to configure one provider:

- Google Maps, or
- Azure Maps.

One valid provider key is enough to start. Provider keys for the V1 RC1 pilot
must be site/user-owned and restricted. Browser map SDK keys are visible to
someone who can access the running browser app, so do not use an unrestricted
shared TowerScout project key.

Google keys must support TowerScout's Maps JavaScript, Places/autocomplete,
Static Maps imagery, and Geocoding usage. Azure Maps subscription keys must
support TowerScout's Web SDK, imagery, search, and geocoding usage.

Expected result: Setup Wizard saves the provider settings and TowerScout reloads
or reports that setup is complete. Do not paste the provider key into issue
reports, screenshots, or support chat.

## 9. Confirm Success

Run:

```powershell
.\scripts\status.cmd -Engine docker
```

If you started with an explicit engine, use the same engine:

```powershell
.\scripts\status.cmd -Engine podman
```

Expected readiness states:

- `setup_required`: TowerScout is running, but provider setup is not complete.
- `degraded`: TowerScout is running, but assets or another recoverable
  capability are missing.
- `ready`: provider setup and required assets are present.
- `fatal`: TowerScout cannot safely serve the app; collect support evidence.

For a small smoke check, open TowerScout, choose a provider, define a small
approved search area, select `Estimate tiles`, then run `Find towers` only for
a small area appropriate for the pilot.

Expected result: status is `ready` before the detection smoke, and the detection
results appear on the map and in the right-hand review panel after the run
completes.

## 10. Stop Or Restart

Stop TowerScout:

```powershell
.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine docker
```

Start again:

```powershell
.\start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off
```

Provider setup and imported assets are stored in named volumes and should
survive container restarts and replacement.

If support asked you to use Podman or another explicit engine, use that same
`-Engine` value on stop and start commands.

## 11. Source, Licenses, And Help

The YOLO-enabled V1 RC1 package/image is not Apache-2.0-only. It is distributed
with AGPL-3.0 obligations because it includes Ultralytics YOLOv5 runtime source
and YOLO-derived detector weights.

Find release notices in the package:

- `LICENSE`
- `NOTICE`
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
- `MODEL_LICENSES.md`
- `DATA_LICENSES.md`
- `PROVIDER_TERMS.md`
- `SOURCE.txt`
- `SBOM.txt`
- `IMAGE.txt`
- `release-manifest.v1.json`

When TowerScout is running, Settings includes Resource Links for Project
Overview, User Guide, Source/licenses, Video Guides, and the research article.
The source/license notice is also available from these local routes:

```text
http://localhost:5000/license      formatted browser page
http://localhost:5000/license.txt  plain-text combined notices
```

Use `/license.txt` when support needs plain text for scripts, copy/paste, or
archival use.

## 12. If Something Fails

Run:

```powershell
.\scripts\status.cmd -Engine docker
.\scripts\logs.cmd -Engine docker -Tail 200
```

Use the same `-Engine` value on status/log commands if support asked you to
start with a specific engine.

If PowerShell says a command is not recognized, confirm the PowerShell prompt is
open in the extracted TowerScout package folder and that the command starts
with `.\`. If Docker commands are not recognized, open Docker Desktop from the
Start menu and wait until it reports that it is running.

Do not share `.env`, provider keys, raw screenshots, raw browser network
traces, cached provider responses, uploaded investigation files, exported
datasets, named-volume contents, or unreviewed raw logs unless your site has an
approved support-handling procedure.
