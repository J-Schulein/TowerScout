# TowerScout Domain Guide

TowerScout is a Flask web application for detecting cooling towers from satellite imagery using YOLOv5 and EfficientNet models. Originally a graduate school project, it has been used in 12+ Legionnaires' disease outbreak investigations across 8 states and is being improved for public accessibility.

## Architecture Overview

**Core Components:**
- `webapp/towerscout.py` - Main Flask app with session-based processing
- `webapp/ts_yolov5.py` - YOLOv5 detector wrapper (batch_size=16, lazy-loaded)
- `webapp/ts_en.py` - EfficientNet secondary classifier (threshold=0.5, lazy-loaded)
- `webapp/ts_maps.py` - Abstract map provider interface
- `webapp/ts_gmaps.py` and `webapp/ts_azure_maps.py` - Google Maps and Azure Maps implementations
- `webapp/ts_events.py` - Event handling and progress tracking system
- `webapp/ts_imgutil.py` - Image processing utilities and coordinate transforms
- `webapp/ts_zipcode.py` - Geographic boundary validation using Census TIGER data
- `webapp/ts_geocoding.py` - Address and location geocoding services
- `webapp/ts_geocache.py` - Caching layer for geocoding and map data
- `webapp/ts_errors.py` - Centralized error handling and custom exceptions
- `webapp/ts_logging.py` - Structured logging system for debugging and monitoring
- `webapp/ts_validation.py` - Input validation and data sanitization utilities
- `Model/` - Jupyter notebooks for training and evaluation
- `SyntheticData/` - Dataset augmentation tools
- `TowerScoutSite/` - Static marketing site

**Data Flow:**
1. User draws polygon or searches by address/zipcode and validated against zipcode boundaries
2. Backend tiles area into 640x640px chunks via `ts_imgutil.make_tiles()`
3. Tile intersection check with `tileIntersectsPolygons()`
4. Downloads satellite imagery asynchronously via map APIs
5. YOLOv5 detection in GPU batches (16 images/batch, semaphore-controlled)
6. EfficientNet classifier filters results (threshold=0.5)
7. Coordinate transformation back to lat/lng with confidence scores
8. Results stored in session for frontend display and dataset export

## Legacy Feature Requirements (Production-Critical)

**Core Detection Workflow:**
- Machine learning-based cooling tower detection with confidence scores
- Multi-provider satellite imagery (Google Maps, Azure Maps) with quality comparison
- Interactive confidence threshold filtering and result toggling
- Automatic address geocoding for detected towers

**Search and Navigation:**
- Location-based searches (city, neighborhood, zipcode with quotes)
- Custom polygon drawing tool for complex search areas
- Circular radius search around specific coordinates
- Tile estimation for processing time prediction (<100 tiles, approx. 30 seconds)
- Map controls (pan, zoom, drag) with provider switching

**Result Review and Editing:**
- Interactive map overlay with clickable tower markers
- Right-panel details (address, confidence, imagery date)
- Bidirectional highlighting (address and map marker)
- False positive deselection via checkboxes
- Manual tower addition using polygon tool
- Tile-by-tile and tower-by-tower review modes

**Export and Data Management:**
- Multi-format export (Excel/CSV for tracking, KML for Google Earth)
- YOLO format dataset export for ML training
- Manual dataset addition via map selection
- Session persistence for iterative labeling workflows

**Outbreak Investigation Workflow (Mission-Critical):**
- Rapid area definition with tile estimation
- Real-time detection progress with cancellation capability
- Systematic review modes for accuracy verification
- Export integration for epidemiological tracking
- **Performance Target:** <100 tiles processed in approx. 30 seconds
- **Accuracy Target:** Manual review capability to ensure detection completeness

**Label Mode (Registry Support):**
- Display all towers in full tiles (including outside search boundaries)
- Tile navigation for comprehensive labeling
- Support for building registries and ML training data collection

**Critical Constraint:** All legacy features must remain operational during any improvements or refactoring. These features support active disease outbreak investigations across multiple states.

## Industry Best Practice Gaps

**Implemented Improvements:**
- Comprehensive error handling via `ts_errors.py` and `ts_validation.py`
- Structured logging system implemented in `ts_logging.py`
- Unit testing framework established with comprehensive test suite
- Enhanced geocoding capabilities via `ts_geocoding.py` and `ts_geocache.py`

**Remaining Architecture Improvements:**
- Reduce tight coupling between components for better testability
- Improve global state management for concurrent requests
- Further separate business logic from Flask routes

## Improvement Goals and Context

**Current State:** Student prototype requiring technical setup (manual downloads, CLI commands, API key files)  
**Target:** User-friendly, locally-deployable tool with Docker containerization and multi-provider API support

**Improvement Priorities (Corrected):**

**Security (CRITICAL):**
1. Remove `apikey.txt` from repository history
2. Implement environment variable configuration
3. Add input validation and rate limiting
4. Use secure session configuration for local deployment

**Code Quality:**
1. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
2. Unit testing framework with comprehensive test coverage and development dependencies
3. Code formatting (black) and linting (flake8) tools available
4. Separate business logic from Flask routes

**Architecture:**
1. Implement dependency injection for testability
2. Add configuration management system
3. Create proper service layer abstractions
4. Add diagnostic endpoints for troubleshooting

**Performance:**
- Current GPU detection works but lacks CPU optimization
- Apply torch.quantization for CPU deployment
- Implement proper async/await patterns (currently mixed sync/async)

## Key Patterns

**Session Management:**
- Flask default sessions (signed cookies, not filesystem)
- Temporary directories in `uploads/` for image processing
- Results stored as `session['results']` and `session['detections']`
- Tile limits: `MAX_TILES=100000`, `MAX_TILES_SESSION=100000`

**Model Loading (Corrected):**
- Both YOLOv5 and EfficientNet are lazy-loaded via `get_engine()` functions
- Thread locks prevent concurrent loading: `self.lock = threading.Lock()`
- GPU memory managed with semaphores: `self.semaphore = threading.Semaphore(1)` (not 8)
- Batch size: 16 images (not 8 as previously documented)
- **Optimization Opportunity:** Apply torch.quantization for CPU deployment

**Map Provider Architecture:**
- Abstract `Map` base class in `ts_maps.py` enables provider selection
- **Current:** Google Maps (primary), Azure Maps (available as alternative)
- API keys stored in environment variables (completed security migration)

**Async Image Processing:**
```python
# Pattern: Batch async downloads then sync GPU processing
urls = [self.get_url(tile) for tile in tiles]
loop.run_until_complete(gather_urls(urls, dir, fname, self.has_metadata))
results_raw = det.detect(tiles, exit_events, id(session))
```

**Coordinate Systems:**
```python
# Critical transformation pipeline:
1. User polygon (lat/lng) to Web Mercator projection
2. Tile generation with geographic bounds checking
3. YOLO detection (normalized 0-1 coordinates)
4. Coordinate transformation back to lat/lng via ts_imgutil
```

**Event System:**
- `ts_events.py` manages progress tracking and user cancellation
- Events stored per session for real-time UI updates
- Thread-safe event handling for concurrent processing

**JavaScript Architecture**
- **Frontend Architecture:**
  - `js/towerscout.js` - Main client-side application logic (3,600+ lines)
  - `js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js` - jQuery dependency for DOM manipulation
- **State Management Classes:**
  - `ProviderStateManager` - Handles map provider switching and prevents race conditions
  - `TimerManager` - Manages setTimeout/setInterval lifecycle and cleanup
  - `EventListenerManager` - Tracks and manages DOM event listeners
  - `TowerScoutErrorHandler` - Client-side error handling and user feedback
- **Core UI Functions:**
  - Map initialization and provider switching (Google Maps and Azure Maps)
  - Interactive polygon drawing and search area definition
  - Real-time detection progress tracking and cancellation
  - Results display with confidence filtering and manual editing
  - Data export workflows (CSV, KML, YOLO format)
- **Search Capabilities:**
  - Address/zipcode geocoding with auto-complete
  - Polygon-based area selection with tile estimation
  - Circular radius search around points of interest
  - Provider-aware search optimization

## Critical Implementation Details

**Map Provider Evolution:**
- **Legacy:** Google Maps + Bing Maps via `apikey.txt` (SECURITY RISK - RESOLVED)
- **Current:** Google Maps + Azure Maps via environment variables
- **Target:** Multi-provider support with environment variables
- Abstract base class `Map` in `ts_maps.py` defines interface
- Each provider implements `get_url()` and `make_tiles()` methods
- **Key Challenge:** Normalize imagery outputs for consistent CV model performance
- Metadata support varies by provider (`has_metadata` flag)

**Thread Safety Issues:**
- Global model instances with threading locks (improvement needed)
- Session data shared across threads without proper synchronization
- Event system lacks proper cleanup mechanisms

**GPU Memory Management:**
- Batch size auto-calculated based on available CUDA memory
- Model instances cleared between requests to prevent OOM
- Thread locks prevent concurrent model loading
- Semaphore limits concurrent GPU operations
- **CPU Support:** Essential for diverse local hardware environments

**UI/UX Modernization:**
- **Current:** Bootstrap template, basic forms
- **Target:** In-app API key management, provider selection dropdown
- Error handling and fallbacks for failed API calls
- User guides with screenshots for non-technical users

**Dataset Export:**
- Users can export labeled datasets as ZIP files
- Generates both YOLO format (.txt) and XML format labels
- Maintains session state for iterative labeling workflows
- Supports dataset upload/restore via `contents.txt` manifest

## File Structure Conventions

- `ts_*.py` - TowerScout module prefix for all backend components
- `model_params/` - Model weights storage (excluded from git)
- `uploads/` - Temporary user files (auto-cleaned)
- `flask_session/` - Session storage directory
- `templates/` - Jinja2 templates for web interface
- Jupyter notebooks use descriptive names ending in purpose (e.g., `_train.ipynb`, `_eval.ipynb`)

## Development Priorities

**Completed Infrastructure:**
- Security: API keys migrated to environment variables
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling system implemented
- Logging: Structured logging system with `ts_logging.py`
- Testing: Unit test framework with integration and mocking capabilities
- Geocoding: Enhanced address lookup and caching system

**Current Focus Areas:**
1. **User Experience**: Streamline local deployment with Docker containerization
2. **Documentation**: Update setup guides for non-technical users
3. **Performance**: Optimize CPU-only deployment scenarios
4. **Multi-Architecture**: Support ARM64/Apple Silicon deployment
5. **Provider Management**: Enhance map provider selection and fallback capabilities
