Current delivery direction: qualify a new release from accepted `main` for
Windows 11 Docker/Podman CPU/NVIDIA use. PR #67 and the Task-087 launcher
redesign are deferred and are not release gates. Preserve their branches,
commits, reviews, and evidence; do not merge, reconcile, extend, or resume them
during this delivery window.

Task status comes from the active board. Acceptance comes from the v2
prioritization document. Static checks, health endpoints, and mocked model tests
do not establish deployment readiness; record actual package, model, device,
provider, persistence, recovery, and independent-host results.

Honor the user's authorized implementation scope without asking again for each
routine step. External publication, account changes, signing, and destructive
cleanup retain their normal authorization boundaries.
