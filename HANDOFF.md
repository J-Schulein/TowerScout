# TowerScout Handoff Guide

**Last Updated**: August 20, 2026
**Operational Closeout**: October 30, 2026
**Hard Project End**: October 31, 2026

## Current State

The validated fork-side `v0.1.2` release is the immutable Pilot Package:

`https://github.com/J-Schulein/TowerScout/releases/tag/v0.1.2`

The cdcai owner selected a fix-first path:

- Keep pilot users on unchanged `v0.1.2`.
- Develop and refine unsigned normal-user previews in
  `J-Schulein/TowerScout` as `v0.1.3-preview.N` GitHub prereleases.
- Reserve `v0.1.3-rc.N` for the production-shaped package built, signed, and
  qualified within Task-100; publish it only after the gates pass.
- Keep `cdcai/TowerScout` unchanged until owner qualification and explicit
  adoption approval.
- Select the official cdcai tag and display title before the official build.

The canonical forward plan is:

- `.agent_work/context/status/Handoff-Planning/2026-07-23-OCTOBER-FIX-FIRST-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`

The current Pilot/cdcai hold is:

- `.agent_work/context/status/Handoff-Planning/PILOT-FEEDBACK-AND-CDC-AI-ADOPTION-PLAN.md`

## Required Final Scope

- Task-090 runtime/custom-image/dependency security investigation: complete
- Task-098 approved dependency remediation and release-risk disposition:
  complete through PR #51 / `e499b50` with its exact July 27 closeout state
- Task-099 August dependency-advisory follow-up: complete through PRs #68/#69
  and `f460445`/`0133b50`; main CI and the root dependency graph passed,
  alert `#74` closed without dismissal, and its August 11 closeout inventory
  contained the eight documented torch residuals
- Task-101 high-severity development-transitive `extract-zip` remediation and
  release-gate disposition: PR #72 squash-merged as `0cc189c`, exact-main checks
  passed, and alert `#76` closed as fixed without dismissal; PR #73 recorded
  the checkpoint and squash-merged as `9276084`, with exact-main CI/CD and
  Task-087 workflows passing; this merge integrates that `main` into PR #67,
  leaving its exact-head validation and later lifecycle update open
- Task-087 Google/Azure guided provider TLS repair on Docker/Podman: paused /
  reconciliation-gated while Draft PR #67 remains open for reviewer input
- Task-096 user-confirmed Exit/Stop on Docker/Podman
- Task-097 Podman CPU/GPU final-path qualification
- Task-100 October production signing and representative managed-endpoint
  qualification after the unsigned package is satisfactory
- Docker CPU, Docker GPU, Podman CPU, and Podman GPU qualification
- owner-runnable qualification, documentation, recovery, governance, backlog,
  and handoff work
- external Setup Guide and demo video refresh

Task-058/059 are conditional stretch work and cannot displace required scope.

Superseded handoff strategies, July roadmap iterations, release checklists, and
external reviews are under
`.agent_work/context/archive/2026-07/Handoff-Planning/`.

The July 23 code-scanning baseline is recorded in
`.agent_work/context/analysis/GITHUB-CODE-SCANNING-READINESS-ASSESSMENT-2026-07-23.md`.
Task-098's merged closeout and the eight documented medium/low torch residuals
are recorded in
`.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-098-dependency-security-remediation.md`.
Task-099 records the completed post-closeout advisory remediation, including
the later js-yaml npm audit finding and root graph reconciliation, in
`.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-099-august-dependency-advisory-follow-up.md`.
Alert `#76` opened after that closeout and is owned by active Task-101 in
`.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-101-extract-zip-advisory-release-gate.md`.
Task-087 remains preserved and reviewable in PR #67, but new implementation,
merge to `main`, and preview/candidate publication wait for green checks at the
new reconciliation head. A subsequent governance update must then mark
Task-101 complete, explicitly resume Task-087, and pass checks again at that
new head before further implementation. PR #72 and alert `#76` default-branch
reconciliation plus PR #73's checkpoint already passed. Existing Task-087
validation artifacts remain nonpublishable. Task-100 owns production signing,
signed-candidate packaging, and representative managed-endpoint qualification
in October; Task-087's other package, provider/recovery, Podman, and endpoint
gates remain closed.

## Runtime And Package Model

Normal release delivery uses:

- GitHub Release control package
- digest-pinned GHCR image
- checksummed shared Model & Data Package
- Docker- and Podman-compatible Compose paths

Unsigned iteration uses immutable `v0.1.3-preview.N` GitHub prereleases on
approved clean unmanaged Windows machines. After the package is satisfactory,
Task-100 builds/signs under `v0.1.3-rc.N`, qualifies those exact bytes, and
publishes/freezes them only after the gates pass. Neither identity authorizes a
cdcai change by itself.

The final support matrix requires:

- Docker CPU
- Docker GPU
- Podman CPU
- Podman GPU/CDI

The existing Pilot validation record remains under
`.agent_work/context/status/Handoff-Planning/v0.1.2-Validation-Evidence/`.
Future candidates require new evidence.

## Runtime Startup Coordination

Before runtime-dependent work, the active agent must:

1. Tell the user whether Docker Desktop, Podman, or both are required.
2. Ask the user to start the required runtime.
3. Wait for confirmation before validation.
4. Allow time for a computer restart when Docker Desktop requires it.

Static review, planning, and documentation work do not require runtime startup.

## Safety And Custody

- Do not replace released `v0.1.2` assets.
- Do not relabel Task-087 validation ZIPs as previews, mark unsigned previews
  `Latest`, or give unsigned bytes an RC identity.
- Do not ask preview testers to disable Windows security controls.
- Do not publish `v0.1.3` final prematurely.
- Do not modify cdcai without explicit owner authorization.
- Do not mount Docker/Podman sockets into the application container.
- Do not delete named volumes during normal stop or upgrade.
- Do not store provider keys, helper tokens, certificate details, private AOIs,
  raw traces, or unsanitized logs in repository evidence.

The Model & Data Package cannot be reconstructed from source alone. Preserve
release assets, SHA-256 sidecars, `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`, and
`docs/release/release-asset-bundle-contract.md`.

## Final Handoff Gate

Before October 30:

- final candidate is qualified and accepted
- Task-100 production signing and representative managed-endpoint
  qualification are complete
- official cdcai identity is selected and built consistently
- release, rollback/reject, recovery, and cleanup are rehearsed by the owner
- repository, Actions, package, documentation, video, and backlog custody are
  confirmed
- tool-neutral maintenance guidance is complete
- remaining tasks and risks are explicitly dispositioned
- every code-scanning alert is dispositioned and no release-blocking
  critical/high dependency risk remains unresolved
- no planned work depends on the outgoing developer after October 31
