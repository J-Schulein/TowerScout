# Provider Terms

TowerScout supports browser and backend integrations with external map and
imagery providers. Provider services are not included with TowerScout.

## Google Maps

Users must supply an approved Google Maps API key and comply with Google's
current platform terms, billing requirements, API restrictions, and quota
controls. Browser SDK keys are visible to the client and should be restricted
by approved HTTP referrers, APIs, quotas, and site policy. For the V1 RC1
local pilot, Google keys are expected to be site/user-owned; unrestricted
shared TowerScout project keys are unsupported.

## Azure Maps

Users must supply an approved Azure Maps subscription key and comply with
Microsoft Azure terms, billing requirements, API restrictions, and quota
controls. Browser SDK keys are visible to the client and should be restricted
and monitored according to site policy. For the V1 RC1 local pilot, Azure keys
are expected to be site/user-owned, monitored, and rotated according to local
policy; unrestricted shared TowerScout project keys are unsupported.

## Release Boundary

The TowerScout source license and AGPL-compliance package do not grant rights
to use Google, Azure, or any other provider service. Provider keys must not be
committed, included in release packages, pasted into issue reports, or shared
with support unless a site-specific handling procedure explicitly approves it.
