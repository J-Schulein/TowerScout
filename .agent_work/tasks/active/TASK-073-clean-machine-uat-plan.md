# TASK-073: Clean-Machine Pilot / UAT Execution Plan

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - package-path UAT plan drafted for owner review
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Type**: B/C (User Testing / Release Validation)  
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day (4-8 hours)  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1  

## Objective

Define the controlled external pilot / UAT workflow for TowerScout V1 RC1 after the internal clean-machine release-candidate gate has passed or produced owner-accepted residual risks.

This task should make external testing repeatable, bounded, and evidence-producing.

## Requirements (EARS Notation)

**R-073-001**: WHEN external pilot/UAT begins, THE PROJECT SHALL provide tester instructions that match the validated V1 RC1 package/docs/assets path.

**R-073-002**: WHEN testers report results, THE PROJECT SHALL capture environment details, package version, asset bundle version, runtime engine, Compose provider, provider used, network/TLS context, and test flow outcome.

**R-073-003**: WHEN testers hit a problem, THE PROJECT SHALL route the report through `.agent_work/user-testing/` using the established issue and artifact workflow.

**R-073-004**: WHEN a pilot test is considered successful, THE PROJECT SHALL have evidence that install, launch, provider setup, bounded detection, and issue reporting are usable under the supported V1 RC1 environment.

**R-073-005**: IF external testers find blockers in install, launch, setup, detection, export, assets, or documentation, THEN THE PROJECT SHALL classify those blockers as V1 fix work unless explicitly owner-accepted.

**R-073-006**: WHEN pilot/UAT completes, THE PROJECT SHALL decide whether V1 is complete, needs V1 patch work, or requires another release candidate.

**R-073-007**: BEFORE broad external pilot/UAT prep begins, THE PROJECT SHALL confirm that the `TASK-066` Flask route-test timeout/isolation gap is fixed or explicitly accepted as an internal-only validation risk.

**R-073-008**: WHEN pilot instructions are provided, THE PROJECT SHALL keep GPU acceleration, Docker-Desktop-free Podman, and Podman source-build support language bounded to the evidence recorded in `TASK-066` and `TASK-075`.

**R-073-009**: WHEN pilot evidence is collected, THE PROJECT SHALL avoid storing API keys, full `.env` files, private AOIs, screenshots with secrets, or raw provider responses unless explicitly approved and redacted.

## Pilot / UAT Execution Plan

### Pilot Start Criteria

Pilot/UAT may start only when all of the following are true:

- The release package ZIP, pinned GHCR image digest, and matching asset bundle location/checksum instructions are available to testers.
- `TASK-071` package docs are available from the package and from Settings Resource Links.
- `TASK-066` CPU-default Docker Desktop package path has passed with assets imported and one bounded detection smoke.
- `TASK-066` residual caveats are explicitly included in pilot support language:
  - Docker Desktop is the primary pilot engine.
  - Podman is qualified only as a package-runtime path when the machine has a working Podman machine and Compose provider.
  - Docker-Desktop-free Podman and Podman source-build/base-image-pull support are not claimed.
  - GPU acceleration is not claimed until NVIDIA Docker Desktop WSL2 validation, CPU/GPU parity, and timing evidence pass.
- `TASK-067` route-test timeout/isolation fix is merged.
- A provider key is available to the tester and has been restricted/managed according to the provider-key release policy chosen for the pilot.
- The tester has a non-sensitive bounded AOI or owner-provided public fixture for the detection smoke.

### Pilot Stop Criteria

Pause or stop pilot/UAT if any of the following occur:

- More than one tester cannot install, launch, or reach Setup Wizard using the documented package path.
- Asset import fails with verified package/assets on a supported engine.
- Provider setup cannot be completed with a valid key and supported network/TLS context.
- A bounded detection cannot complete on the owner-provided fixture after one supported retry.
- Logs or support diagnostics expose secrets or private data.
- The same HIGH or BLOCKER issue is reported by multiple testers.
- The release package, image digest, asset bundle, or docs are found to be mismatched.

### Supported Pilot Path

- **OS**: Windows 11 AMD64.
- **Runtime**: Docker Desktop is the primary pilot engine.
- **Launch mode**: CPU-default launch with `-Gpu off`.
- **Provider**: Azure Maps or Google Maps, with the provider used recorded in the report.
- **Assets**: Package-local `assets/` import using the documented asset bundle and hash verification.
- **Detection smoke**: Owner-provided public fixture or non-sensitive bounded AOI, preferably 1-6 tiles.
- **Out of scope unless explicitly approved**: GPU acceleration claims, Docker-Desktop-free Podman support, source-build validation, restricted-network/offline preload, large AOIs, and private/sensitive screenshot collection.

### Tester Acceptance Checklist

Each tester should complete the package path in this order:

1. Confirm prerequisites: Windows 11 AMD64, supported container engine, browser, outbound internet, disk space, PowerShell access, provider key.
2. Download or receive the release package ZIP, asset bundle, and checksum/digest instructions.
3. Extract the release package to a local folder without spaces or special characters if possible.
4. Extract the asset bundle into the package-local `assets/` folder.
5. Launch CPU-default Docker Desktop path:
   - `start.bat -Engine docker -Gpu off`
6. Import assets with hash verification:
   - `scripts\import-assets.cmd -Engine docker -Source assets -VerifyHashes -RestartWaitSeconds 180`
7. Open TowerScout in the browser if the launcher does not open it automatically.
8. Complete Setup Wizard with Azure or Google provider key.
9. Open Settings Resource Links and confirm the package-local docs and source/license page load.
10. Run a bounded detection smoke using the owner-provided fixture or a non-sensitive AOI.
11. Confirm:
    - Detection completes without a crash.
    - Results appear in the map and right-hand review panel.
    - Detected tower addresses/provider metadata appear when geocoding succeeds or show a clear fallback when unavailable.
    - CSV or KML export can be generated if included in the pilot script.
12. Collect status/log evidence requested below.
13. Stop TowerScout using the package stop script or documented shutdown path.

### Environment Capture

Capture these details for every pilot run:

- Tester name or role.
- Date/time and time zone.
- Windows version and CPU architecture.
- Runtime engine: Docker Desktop or Podman.
- Engine version and whether Docker Desktop was running.
- Compose provider/version if visible.
- TowerScout package version and folder name.
- Image tag and digest from the package manifest or launch output.
- Asset bundle version/checksum status and asset import result.
- Launch command and port.
- GPU mode requested (`off`, `auto`, or `on`); expected pilot default is `off`.
- Provider used: Azure Maps or Google Maps.
- Whether the machine is behind a proxy, custom TLS inspection, VPN, or restricted network.
- Detection fixture/AOI name, tile count estimate, and whether the AOI is public/non-sensitive.
- Final outcome: PASS, PASS_WITH_NOTES, BLOCKED, or FAIL.

### Evidence Collection

Collect only the minimum useful evidence:

- Launcher output showing image digest, engine, port, and readiness result.
- Asset import output showing `VerifyHashes` success or exact failure.
- `/api/health` and `/api/readiness` summary if available.
- Screenshot of the failing step only when it does not expose secrets or sensitive AOIs.
- Browser-visible error text.
- Sanitized logs when requested by support.

Do not collect API keys, full `.env` files, private AOI screenshots, raw provider responses, or unredacted logs with secrets.

### Issue Reporting Workflow

Use `.agent_work/user-testing/` for pilot reports:

1. Save raw evidence under `.agent_work/user-testing/artifacts/YYYY-MM-DD-ut-###-short-slug/`.
2. Create or update `.agent_work/user-testing/issues/UT-###-short-slug.md` using `ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md`.
3. Update `.agent_work/user-testing/issue-tracker.md`.
4. Link each issue to the owning task:
   - Install/launch/runtime prerequisite issues -> `TASK-074` candidate.
   - Package/docs/assets mismatch -> `TASK-066` or `TASK-071`.
   - Provider key or exposure policy -> `TASK-076`.
   - GPU-specific findings -> `TASK-075`.
   - Detection correctness/performance -> `TASK-079`, `TASK-026`, or a new V1 patch task depending on severity.
5. Move issues through the existing status lifecycle: `NEW`, `WAITING-FOR-ARTIFACTS`, `TRIAGED`, `IN-PROGRESS`, `READY-FOR-RETEST`, `CLOSED`.

### Triage Rules

- **V1 blocker**: prevents package extraction, launch, asset import, provider setup, bounded detection, or safe support evidence collection on the supported pilot path.
- **V1 patch candidate**: core path works, but a defect requires a documented workaround, affects multiple testers, or undermines confidence in the first release.
- **Documentation fix**: behavior is acceptable but tester instructions are unclear, missing, or easy to misread.
- **V2 backlog**: enhancement, large-AOI performance improvement, non-default GPU path, Docker-Desktop-free Podman path, advanced workflow, or architecture improvement not needed for the first controlled pilot.
- **Accepted risk**: residual caveat explicitly approved by owner/reviewer and documented in release notes or pilot support language.

### Support Escalation

First-line support should triage in this order:

1. Confirm the tester is using the supported package path and current package/assets.
2. Confirm Docker Desktop is running and the package launched with CPU-default `-Gpu off`.
3. Confirm assets imported with hash verification.
4. Confirm provider key setup succeeded without asking the tester to send the key.
5. Confirm `/api/health` and `/api/readiness` state.
6. Collect sanitized launcher/import/readiness evidence.
7. Create or update the matching `UT-###` issue and route by triage rules.

Escalate to engineering when the issue is a V1 blocker, repeats across testers, affects security/privacy, or contradicts `TASK-066` validation evidence.

### V1 Completion Gate After Pilot

After pilot/UAT, V1 may be considered ready only if:

- Supported package path succeeds for the selected pilot cohort.
- No open BLOCKER issues remain.
- HIGH issues are fixed, explicitly accepted, or converted into a bounded V1 patch plan.
- User-facing docs match the tested package path.
- Release notes list accepted caveats and unsupported paths.
- Provider-key handling and support language are approved.
- Remaining GPU, Podman, and restricted-network claims are bounded to validated evidence.

## Implementation Log

### 2026-05-11 - Task Created
**Objective**: Create detailed Sprint 06 task documentation for clean-machine pilot / UAT execution planning.  
**Context**: Sprint 06 planning separates internal release-candidate validation from external pilot/UAT. External testing should start only after `TASK-066` validates or dispositiones the package/docs/assets path.  
**Decision**: Keep this task focused on UAT planning and evidence workflow, not on fixing release-candidate defects. Defects found by `TASK-066` should be routed before pilot start.  
**Execution**: Created `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-073-clean-machine-uat-plan.md` and synchronized the task with `current-tasks.md`.  
**Output**: Task file ready for intake.  
**Validation**: Pending `.agent_work` validation after all Sprint 06 task files are created.  
**Next**: Wait for `TASK-066` findings, then build the pilot/UAT checklist and handoff flow.

### 2026-05-27 - Pre-Pilot Test-Harness Dependency Added
**Objective**: Carry forward the `TASK-066` route-test timeout/isolation finding before starting UAT planning.
**Context**: `TASK-066` package-runtime validation passed with boundaries, but repeated broad pytest review commands isolated a test-harness gap in `tests/unit/test_flask_routes.py`: the module can stall during collection because it imports the full production Flask app and local `.env` path before fixtures isolate config.
**Decision**: `TASK-073` should not start broad external pilot prep until this gap is fixed or the owner explicitly accepts it as an internal-only validation risk. The issue does not require Docker Desktop or Podman to reproduce and should be routed to `TASK-067` and/or `TASK-068` if fixed before pilot prep.
**Output**: Added a requirement, acceptance criterion, dependency note, and implementation-plan step for the route-test gap disposition.
**Validation**: Pending `.agent_work` validation.
**Next**: Complete `TASK-066` review disposition, then either fix the route-test isolation/timeout issue or explicitly accept the risk before drafting the pilot/UAT workflow.

### 2026-05-27 - Package-Path Pilot/UAT Plan Drafted
**Objective**: Start `TASK-073` after the route-test timeout/isolation dependency was closed by `TASK-067` / PR #19.
**Context**: `TASK-066` validated the CPU-default Docker Desktop and qualified Podman package-runtime paths with bounded caveats. `TASK-067` merged pytest timeout safeguards and route-test runtime isolation, removing the main pre-pilot test-harness blocker.
**Decision**: Draft the pilot/UAT plan around the validated package path, with Docker Desktop as the primary pilot engine, CPU-default launch, package-local asset import, and explicit boundaries around GPU, Docker-Desktop-free Podman, source-build validation, restricted-network support, and private AOI evidence.
**Execution**: Added start/stop criteria, supported pilot path, tester acceptance checklist, environment capture, evidence collection, issue reporting, triage rules, support escalation, and V1 completion gate.
**Output**: `TASK-073` now contains a reviewable package-path UAT plan and points to the user-testing workspace for evidence handling.
**Validation**: Pending owner/reviewer acceptance and `.agent_work` validation.
**Next**: Validate `.agent_work`, review the draft with the owner/reviewer, and identify the final package/assets/checksum inputs before tester launch.
