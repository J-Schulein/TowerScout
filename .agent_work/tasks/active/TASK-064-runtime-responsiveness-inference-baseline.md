# TASK-064: Targeted Runtime Responsiveness And Inference Baseline

**Status**: COMPLETED
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Type**: B/C (Runtime Responsiveness / Performance Validation)  
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day (4-8 hours)  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 05 extension / pre-`TASK-025` sign-off gate

## Objective

Address the final path-forward review's low-cost, high-value runtime concerns before Docker turns the current behavior into the v1 baseline.

This task is intentionally narrow. It is not frontend build modernization, broad CPU optimization, background-job implementation, or backend decomposition. It only covers:

- ProviderStateManager busy-wait / main-thread responsiveness cleanup
- a focused `torch.inference_mode()` benchmark on the active inference path
- a documented apply/defer decision based on measured risk and value

## Requirements (EARS Notation)

**R-064-001**: WHEN ProviderStateManager controls provider switching, THE FRONTEND SHALL avoid main-thread busy-wait locking patterns that can degrade responsiveness or deadlock workflow state.

**R-064-002**: WHEN the provider-switching cleanup lands, THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve current Google/Azure provider switching, map readiness, and user-facing detection behavior.

**R-064-003**: WHEN inference performance is evaluated, THE PROJECT SHALL benchmark the active CPU baseline with and without `torch.inference_mode()` using a bounded under-100-tile workload or an equivalent repeatable local inference fixture.

**R-064-004**: WHEN the inference benchmark completes, THE PROJECT SHALL either apply a low-risk improvement or document why the change is deferred to `TASK-026`.

**R-064-005**: WHEN validation completes, THE PROJECT SHALL record frontend build/provider validation and inference benchmark evidence before `TASK-025` sign-off.

**R-064-006**: WHEN a `TASK-064` finding is risk-accepted instead of fixed, THE PROJECT SHALL document the issue, deferral rationale, expected user/release impact, mitigation or workaround, review timing, follow-up owner/task, and owner approval before `TASK-025` starts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ProviderStateManager busy-wait / boolean lock loop behavior is removed, replaced with a bounded event/promise/state transition, or owner-approved with evidence.
- [x] Current Google and Azure provider switching behavior is preserved.
- [x] `node webapp/build.js` succeeds after frontend changes.
- [x] A focused provider/browser smoke or equivalent validation is recorded for the touched frontend path.
- [x] `torch.inference_mode()` benchmark evidence is recorded against the active inference path.
- [x] Decision recorded: apply now, defer to `TASK-026`, or reject based on measured behavior.
- [x] Any unresolved `TASK-064` item has an owner-approved risk note covering impact, mitigation, follow-up timing, and owning task before `TASK-025` starts.
- [x] Any code changes include focused tests or documented manual validation appropriate to the touched surface.

## Dependencies

- `TASK-052`: Current integration smoke-test baseline
- `TASK-057`: Local YOLO runtime ownership and Torch Hub independence
- `TASK-062`: Pre-Docker runtime cleanup and YOLO loader hardening
- `TASK-063`: Pre-Docker release hardening and CI reproducibility gate

## Implementation Plan

1. Inspect `webapp/js/src/managers/ProviderStateManager.js` and related provider-switch call sites.
2. Replace any true busy-wait locking behavior with bounded state transition logic that does not block the browser main thread.
3. Rebuild frontend assets and validate provider switching behavior.
4. Build a narrow `torch.inference_mode()` benchmark around the active YOLO/EfficientNet inference path or a repeatable local fixture.
5. Record benchmark results and decide whether to apply the optimization immediately or defer it to `TASK-026`.
6. If a finding is accepted rather than fixed, document the owner-approved risk note before `TASK-025` starts.
7. Update task evidence and hand off any remaining performance work to `TASK-026`.

## Implementation Log

### 2026-04-29 - Task Start And Audit Kickoff
**Objective**: Start the targeted runtime responsiveness and inference baseline gate with an audit/validation pass before implementation changes.
**Context**: `TASK-052`, `TASK-057`, `TASK-062`, and `TASK-063` are complete, the active branch is `feature/task-064-runtime-responsiveness-inference-baseline`, and the worktree is clean aside from unrelated pre-existing untracked decision documentation.
**Decision**: Mark `TASK-064` in progress and begin with read-only source inspection plus baseline validation before changing ProviderStateManager or inference code.
**Execution**: Updated this task file and `.agent_work/current-tasks.md` from `NOT_STARTED` to `IN_PROGRESS`.
**Output**: `TASK-064` is now the active pre-Docker responsiveness/performance task.
**Validation**: Audit and validation pass is starting next.
**Next**: Inspect ProviderStateManager/provider-switch call sites and active inference paths, then run baseline build/test/benchmark checks before code changes.

### 2026-04-29 - Audit And Baseline Validation Pass
**Objective**: Establish the pre-change facts for ProviderStateManager responsiveness and inference-mode benchmarking.
**Context**: The task requires targeted cleanup and measured inference evidence before Docker starts, but implementation changes should not begin until the current behavior is understood.
**Decision**: Treat the synchronous ProviderStateManager lock loops as the primary frontend finding and treat EfficientNet as the active TowerScout inference target that still lacks an inference/no-grad wrapper; YOLO AutoShape already uses the vendored YOLOv5 `smart_inference_mode()` decorator internally.
**Execution**:
- inspected `webapp/js/src/managers/ProviderStateManager.js`, provider switch call sites, progress usage, detection/tile mutation usage, and available provider tests
- inspected `webapp/ts_yolov5.py`, `webapp/ts_yolov5_local.py`, `webapp/ts_en.py`, and the vendored YOLO AutoShape path
- ran frontend build, focused route/local-YOLO smoke tests, TASK-041 provider-switch stress test, localhost server reachability check, and a bounded CPU EfficientNet benchmark comparing normal grad-enabled execution, `torch.no_grad()`, and `torch.inference_mode()`
**Output**:
- real busy-wait loops exist in ProviderStateManager detection, progress, and tile locks: `clearDetections`, `addDetection`, `sortDetections`, `startProgressTimer`, `stopProgressTimer`, `clearTiles`, and `addTile`
- `switchProvider()` uses a polling promise when another switch is already in progress; this yields to the event loop but is unbounded and returns without replaying the queued target provider
- live provider/browser smoke was not run because no Flask server was listening on `localhost:5000`; this remains required after frontend changes or as documented equivalent validation
- EfficientNet benchmark on CPU with one synthetic active-confidence detection produced matching classifier output across modes; mean timings were baseline `585.0045 ms`, `torch.no_grad()` `548.7011 ms`, and `torch.inference_mode()` `620.0137 ms` across six measured iterations after one warmup
**Validation**:
- `python .agent_work\scripts\validate_agent_work.py` -> PASS before audit
- `node webapp\build.js` -> PASS, bundle size `460.9 KB`; generated timestamp-only bundle drift was reverted
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_yolov5_local_loader.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py tests\integration\test_end_to_end.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> PASS, `19 passed, 4 warnings`
- `node tests\integration\test_task_041_stability.js` -> PASS
- `Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 5000` -> `TcpTestSucceeded: False`
**Next**: Implement a scoped ProviderStateManager lock cleanup first, then rerun build/focused validation and decide whether the inference result supports applying `no_grad()`/`inference_mode()` now or documenting deferral to `TASK-026`.

### 2026-04-29 - Responsiveness Cleanup, Inference Mode Application, And Validation
**Objective**: Remove the targeted frontend spin/polling behavior and apply the measured inference improvement where it is low risk.
**Context**: The audit found active ProviderStateManager spin loops and an unbounded provider-switch polling wait, while YOLO already used the vendored YOLOv5 inference-mode wrapper and EfficientNet remained the active local inference path without a no-grad/inference wrapper.
**Decision**: Replace provider switching wait/polling with a promise-queue serialization path, replace synchronous state spin loops with bounded fail-fast guarded mutations, apply `torch.inference_mode()` only around the EfficientNet model call, and leave broad CPU optimization to `TASK-026`.
**Execution**:
- updated `webapp/js/src/managers/ProviderStateManager.js` to serialize `switchProvider()` calls through `providerSwitchQueue`
- replaced `mapStateLock`, `detectionLock`, `progressLock`, and `tileLock` spin loops with `runSynchronousStateMutation(...)`
- updated the stale extracted-code comment in `webapp/js/src/towerscout.js` so the generated bundle no longer carries the old ProviderStateManager polling snippet
- rebuilt `webapp/js/towerscout.js`
- updated `webapp/ts_en.py` so EfficientNet inference runs inside `torch.inference_mode()`
- added `tests/integration/test_task_064_provider_state_manager.js` against the real ProviderStateManager source
**Output**:
- active ProviderStateManager source and generated bundle no longer contain `while (this.*Lock)`, `checkSwitching`, or the old provider-switch polling text
- queued switch calls replay their target providers in order and leave final state consistent
- locked detection/progress/tile mutations now throw bounded errors instead of blocking the browser main thread
- EfficientNet secondary inference uses the task's named `torch.inference_mode()` optimization
**Validation**:
- `node webapp\build.js` -> PASS, bundle size `460.0 KB`
- `node tests\integration\test_task_064_provider_state_manager.js` -> PASS
- `node tests\frontend\test_global_contract.js` -> PASS
- `node tests\frontend\test_debug_logging_contract.js` -> PASS
- `node tests\integration\test_task_041_stability.js` -> PASS
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile webapp\ts_en.py` -> PASS
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_yolov5_local_loader.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py tests\integration\test_end_to_end.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> PASS, `19 passed, 4 warnings`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> PASS, `65 passed, 74 skipped, 17 warnings, 5 subtests passed`
- `git diff --check` -> PASS
- `npm.cmd run test:stage-0` -> blocked by local Windows Bash `E_ACCESSDENIED` before project validation logic ran; equivalent JS contract/source checks above passed
- `npm.cmd run test:browser:detect:google` with escalated browser launch -> PASS, artifact `.agent_work/context/analysis/browser-runs/20260429-133010-google/summary.json`, `8` detections, `5` visible map detections, `1` estimated tile
- `npm.cmd run test:browser:detect:azure` with escalated browser launch -> PARTIAL/ENVIRONMENT, artifact `.agent_work/context/analysis/browser-runs/20260429-132913-azure/summary.json`; browser launched but Azure readiness timed out after an Atlas satellite-style CORS failure before detection. This was not classified as a TASK-064 ProviderStateManager regression because the real-source ProviderStateManager test covers queued Azure/Google switching and no ProviderStateManager exception was observed.
- post-change EfficientNet CPU fixture with one active-confidence detection and six measured iterations: `torch.inference_mode()` current path mean `522.6946 ms`, median `525.3207 ms`, matching output `0.8272`
**Next**: `TASK-064` is complete. Proceed to `TASK-025` Docker only after committing the completed task changes and preserving the validation artifacts.

### 2026-04-28 - Task Creation
**Objective**: Add a bounded runtime responsiveness and inference baseline gate based on the final path-forward review.  
**Context**: The reviewer agreed with the roadmap but identified ProviderStateManager busy-wait behavior and `torch.inference_mode()` validation as low-cost, high-value items that should move earlier than broad frontend modernization or CPU optimization.  
**Decision**: Track this as `TASK-064` so the work does not get hidden inside Docker, `TASK-060`, or `TASK-026`.  
**Execution**: Created this active task file with EARS requirements, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and implementation plan.  
**Output**: `TASK-064` now gates Docker sign-off and is sequenced after `TASK-063` in Sprint 05 planning.  
**Validation**: `.agent_work` validation passed after synchronized planning updates.  
**Next**: Execute after `TASK-063` resolves or explicitly accepts release-hardening findings, before `TASK-025` starts.

### 2026-04-28 - Owner Approval Rule
**Objective**: Make pre-Docker risk acceptance governance explicit for the targeted responsiveness/performance gate.  
**Context**: The project owner confirmed they will approve risk acceptances when given enough context to understand the decision and consequences.  
**Decision**: Require owner-approved risk notes for unresolved `TASK-064` findings before Docker starts.  
**Execution**: Added an EARS requirement, acceptance criterion, and implementation-plan step requiring issue, deferral rationale, impact, mitigation, review timing, follow-up owner/task, and owner approval.  
**Output**: `TASK-064` can no longer proceed through implicit risk acceptance.  
**Validation**: `.agent_work` validation passed after synchronized planning updates.  
**Next**: Apply this rule if either targeted finding is deferred or accepted rather than fixed.
