# TASK-025: Docker / OCI Containerization

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - PHASE 2 OCI IMAGE AND COMPOSE VALIDATION
**Priority**: HIGH
**Type**: C (Infrastructure / Deployment Readiness)
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 05 extension after `TASK-063` and `TASK-064`

## Objective

Create the Docker-compatible / OCI runtime baseline for TowerScout's supported v1 local deployment path on top of the corrected Sprint 05 runtime, smoke-test baseline, pre-Docker release-hardening gate, and targeted responsiveness/performance gate.

`TASK-025` is the container build/run and persistence task. It must not absorb launcher UX, background jobs, native installer work, broad backend decomposition, or release-hardening items owned by `TASK-063`.

After the May 4 Docker Desktop licensing and Podman reviews, this task should be implemented as an engine-aware OCI-compatible baseline rather than a Docker Desktop-specific product path. Docker Desktop, Podman Desktop, Linux Docker, Linux Podman, or a remote managed container host may be valid runtime hosts only after the relevant licensing, installation, virtualization, networking, Compose/provider, and support prerequisites are validated for the intended user environment.

After the May 4 open-source deployment review, client feedback, and follow-up decision review, the pre-task direction is now locked: use GitHub Releases as the default user-facing release control plane, publish/pin the application image through a registry-backed OCI path where possible, treat Podman as the preferred open-source Windows runtime target with a release-gated compatibility spike, keep Docker compatibility for licensed/approved and support/developer environments, and avoid making raw source clone/build the default end-user path.

## Finalized Pre-Task-025 Decisions

These decisions are accepted as the starting contract for `TASK-025`. The only adjustment mark is that **Podman-first is a selected target, not an already-proven release promise**; the Windows Podman Desktop / Podman machine compatibility spike remains a release gate before end-user support language can promise Podman.

- **Supported v1 user environment**: Windows 11/AMD64, single-user local use, CPU-first. NVIDIA/CUDA remains optional on compatible AMD64 hosts only after validation. Mac, ARM64, offline, air-gapped, VDI, shared multi-user deployment, native installer behavior, and managed/remote hosting are not v1 promises.
- **Runtime host position**: Podman Desktop plus WSL2/Hyper-V is the preferred open-source Windows runtime target after the spike passes. Docker Desktop remains a compatible secondary path only where licensing, procurement, endpoint policy, and installation prerequisites are approved. Linux Docker/Podman may be used as reference/developer/CI paths where practical.
- **Distribution strategy**: Use a GitHub Release ZIP as the normal user-facing package. The package should include quick-start docs, `compose.yaml`, `.env` template, start/stop/logs/status scripts, asset manifest, checksums, troubleshooting guidance, and a pinned GHCR image reference by digest. Optional OCI image archives are restricted-network fallbacks, not the default path.
- **Source clone/build boundary**: Clone/download source remains a developer/support workflow. Normal users should not need host Python, Node, GDAL, PyTorch, or local build steps.
- **Large asset strategy**: Large model/data assets stay out of git and out of the default source checkout. They should be managed by a versioned manifest, downloaded/imported into durable storage, staged before activation, verified with SHA-256, rechecked on startup/update, and recoverable through a manual/restricted-network import path.
- **Asset hosting/source**: GitHub Releases should host release metadata, manifests, checksums, and package files. Large binaries may live in governed object storage or an internal mirror when size, bandwidth, policy, or access control makes direct GitHub asset hosting unsuitable.
- **Persistence profile**: Named volumes are the default supported persistence profile. A host-visible data-directory profile may be offered only as an explicitly documented optional profile after validation.
- **Health/readiness contract**: `TASK-025` should provide `/api/health` for basic liveness and `/api/readiness` for structured startup state. Readiness states should include `starting`, `setup_required`, `degraded`, `ready`, and `fatal`, with redacted details for config, assets, provider setup, version, and recovery guidance.
- **Validation strategy**: Baseline CI should build the image and prove health/readiness without requiring private or heavyweight assets. Release-candidate/local validation should run the real asset bootstrap and detection smoke path.
- **Documentation strategy**: Ship two documentation layers: a GitHub-first end-user/operator guide and a technical OCI runtime contract. Both must state prerequisites, unsupported environments, asset handling, persistence, reset/update, troubleshooting, support diagnostics, and sensitive local data handling.
- **Open-source clarification**: The runtime/tooling path is open-source-friendly through Podman. TowerScout's application license/open-source suitability remains a separate product/legal clarification and is not solved by selecting Podman.

## V1 Scope Assumptions

- Single-user local deployment only.
- Windows/AMD64 is the first supported user target.
- Normal outbound internet access is required.
- CPU execution is the supported baseline.
- NVIDIA/CUDA is optional acceleration on compatible AMD64 hosts.
- Docker-compatible / OCI containerization is the first runtime baseline, not the final managed installer.
- Docker Desktop must not be assumed available for government users unless licensing, procurement, and endpoint prerequisites are approved for the intended user group.
- Podman may reduce Docker Desktop product/licensing dependency, but Windows Podman still depends on a Linux VM path such as WSL2 or Hyper-V plus engine, machine, Compose, proxy/certificate, and support validation.
- Podman should be treated as the preferred open-source runtime target, not as a promised supported user runtime until the Windows Podman Desktop/Podman machine compatibility spike passes or is explicitly risk-accepted.
- `TASK-025` should avoid Docker Desktop-only implementation assumptions and keep commands, validation, and future launcher hooks engine-aware where practical.
- GitHub Releases should be the default user-facing delivery path for release notes, quick-start docs, scripts, Compose-compatible config, asset manifests, checksums, troubleshooting, and a pinned GHCR image reference by digest. Optional OCI image archives are restricted-network fallbacks.
- Local clone-and-build from GitHub is a developer/support path, not the preferred v1 path for normal end users.
- Large model/data assets should not be committed to the git repository; they require a checksummed manifest/bootstrap path and a manual or restricted-network fallback bundle.
- A host-visible data-directory profile may be offered for sites that need inspectable local folders, but named volumes remain the safer default supported persistence mechanism unless validation proves otherwise.
- The client's "open source" requirement may refer to runtime tooling, application licensing, or both; TowerScout's `CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0` license should be clarified as a separate product/legal decision before release promises are made.
- Mac, ARM64, offline, air-gapped, VDI, shared multi-user, and native installer promises are out of scope for this task.

## Implementation Log

### 2026-04-28 - Task File Creation
**Objective**: Create task-specific documentation for the Docker baseline after the plan sufficiency review.  
**Context**: `TASK-025` existed in `current-tasks.md` but did not have an individual active task file. The latest review confirmed Docker-first sequencing while requiring clearer v1 runtime, persistence, asset, and support contracts.  
**Decision**: Keep `TASK-025` focused on container build/run behavior and require the v1 runtime contract before implementation is considered complete.  
**Execution**: Created this task file with EARS requirements, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and implementation plan.  
**Output**: `TASK-025` now has task-specific active documentation.  
**Validation**: Pending `.agent_work` structure validation.  
**Next**: Start only after `TASK-063` clears or records owner-approved explicit risk acceptance.

### 2026-04-28 - Final Path-Forward Review Expansion
**Objective**: Tighten the Docker runtime contract around persistence versioning, cache/geocode state, and upload limits.  
**Context**: The final path-forward review agreed with Docker sequencing but recommended making the persistence map a formally versioned v1 contract and aligning Docker runtime behavior with upload-limit decisions.  
**Decision**: Keep these requirements in `TASK-025` because they define container runtime behavior after `TASK-063` sets policy.  
**Execution**: Added EARS requirements and acceptance criteria for versioned persistence, cache/geocode classification, and upload-limit preservation.  
**Output**: `TASK-025` now requires Docker to implement the v1 runtime contract explicitly.  
**Validation**: `.agent_work` validation passed after synchronized planning updates.  
**Next**: Start only after `TASK-063` and `TASK-064` clear or record owner-approved explicit risk acceptance.

### 2026-04-28 - Owner Approval Rule
**Objective**: Prevent Docker work from starting on implicit risk acceptance.  
**Context**: The project owner confirmed they will approve risk acceptances when given enough context to understand the decision and consequences.  
**Decision**: Treat owner-approved risk notes as required evidence for any unresolved `TASK-063` or `TASK-064` item before `TASK-025` starts.  
**Execution**: Updated requirements, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and implementation plan to require owner-approved risk acceptance before Docker implementation begins.  
**Output**: Docker start criteria now require either cleared pre-Docker gates or documented owner approval for accepted residual risk.  
**Validation**: `.agent_work` validation passed after synchronized planning updates.  
**Next**: Confirm gate status before starting Docker implementation.

### 2026-04-30 - PR 6 Readiness Follow-Up Intake
**Objective**: Record the remaining follow-up items from the final `TASK-064` PR-readiness review before Docker work starts.
**Context**: PR #6 addressed the direct `TASK-064` review findings by adding PR-time frontend CI coverage and a provider-switch queue-recovery test. The remaining reviewer concerns are Docker/startup documentation and local Windows `test:stage-0` portability.
**Decision**: Treat Docker documentation, persistence/run guidance, and container validation as `TASK-025` implementation work. Treat the Windows/Bash `test:stage-0` issue as a tooling portability follow-up unless it blocks Docker validation.
**Execution**: Added this intake note rather than expanding PR #6 into Docker implementation or frontend build modernization.
**Output**:
- `TASK-025` should include explicit Docker user/support documentation for persistence mounts, supported hosts, first-run assets, diagnostics, and recovery paths.
- `TASK-025` should not rely on `npm run test:stage-0` as the only frontend validation path on Windows unless the Bash dependency is replaced or a portable equivalent is provided.
- Azure browser smoke remains an accepted local-provider-readiness caveat for `TASK-064`; Docker validation should still exercise configured provider readiness and report failures as provider/environment issues rather than container regressions when appropriate.
**Validation**: This is a planning intake note; implementation validation remains pending under `TASK-025`.
**Next**: Start `TASK-025` from latest `main` after PR #6 lands and verify these notes during the initial Docker audit/validation pass.

### 2026-04-30 - First-Run Secret-Key Persistence Clarification
**Objective**: Ensure Docker first-run behavior does not require end users to manually understand or create a Flask secret key.
**Context**: The current host runtime generates a temporary in-memory secret when `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` is absent, but it does not write that generated value back to `.env`. For Docker v1, replacing or restarting the container must not silently rotate session-signing state when the persistent config file is empty.
**Decision**: Require `TASK-025` to generate a secure `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` on first Docker startup when missing, persist it to `webapp/config/.env`, reuse it across restarts, and avoid exposing it in UI/status surfaces.
**Execution**: Added `R-025-012`, an acceptance criterion, and implementation-plan validation coverage for empty-config secret-key generation and restart persistence.
**Output**: `TASK-025` now explicitly tracks automatic first-run `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` generation and persistence as part of Docker completion.
**Validation**: Documentation update only; implementation validation remains pending under `TASK-025`.
**Next**: During Docker implementation, test with an empty persistent config volume, verify `.env` receives `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`, restart/recreate the container, and confirm the value is unchanged.

### 2026-05-01 - Containerization Decision Analysis
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive decision-support analysis before Docker implementation starts.
**Context**: `TASK-025` still needs final decisions around the container roadmap, v1 scope, asset strategy, persistence map, startup behavior, health/readiness, validation, support diagnostics, and future launcher/native-packaging direction.
**Decision**: Keep the detailed decision analysis with the owning task support artifacts and use it as the Phase 1 decision register for `TASK-025`.
**Execution**: Created `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-025/TASK-025-CONTAINERIZATION-DECISION-ANALYSIS-2026-05-01.md`.
**Output**: The project now has a self-contained roadmap/context/decision document covering remaining Docker strategy options, pros/cons, recommendations, second-review findings, and a proposed `TASK-025` phase breakdown.
**Validation**: Documentation update only; structure validation should be run after this documentation change.
**Next**: Review the decision register with the owner, record accepted/modified decisions, then begin Docker implementation from the locked runtime contract.

### 2026-05-04 - Docker Desktop Licensing And Podman Review Intake
**Objective**: Record reviewer feedback and runtime-host implications discovered after the May 4 Docker Desktop licensing and Podman analyses.
**Context**: The Docker Desktop licensing review concluded that government use of Docker Desktop creates a concrete licensing/procurement and managed-endpoint gate, but does not invalidate TowerScout's generic containerization work. The Podman review concluded that Podman can reduce Docker Desktop product dependency and fits the OCI/container contract, but Windows Podman still requires a Linux VM path such as WSL2 or Hyper-V and has Compose/provider, proxy/certificate, and support nuances.
**Decision**: Reframe `TASK-025` as a Docker-compatible / OCI container runtime baseline rather than a Docker Desktop-specific product path. Preserve the current container build/run/persistence strategy while making validation, launcher handoff, and documentation engine-aware enough to support Docker or Podman after host-runtime feasibility is validated.
**Execution**: Updated the objective, scope assumptions, requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation plan to capture Docker Desktop licensing/endpoint gates, Podman feasibility gates, engine-aware validation, and the need for a Podman compatibility spike before promising Podman as an end-user runtime.
**Output**: `TASK-025` now distinguishes the application container contract from host-specific Docker Desktop, Podman Desktop, Linux engine, or remote-host delivery choices.
**Validation**: Documentation update only; implementation validation remains pending under `TASK-025`.
**Next**: Update the decision analysis addendum/status table, validate `.agent_work` structure, and then review the remaining decision items with the owner before implementation starts.

### 2026-05-04 - Decision Register Status Update
**Objective**: Confirm which `TASK-025` decision items still need answers after the Docker Desktop licensing and Podman review findings.
**Context**: The May 1 decision analysis listed 40 decision items. The later reviews did not invalidate the recommendations, but they changed the runtime-host decision from a Docker Desktop assumption into an engine-aware container host choice.
**Decision**: Keep the full decision register active, but classify the remaining decisions into two groups: items needing explicit owner/product sign-off before release, and items with strong recommendations that mainly need acceptance and implementation validation.
**Execution**: Added a "Decision Status After May 4 Reviews" section to the decision analysis, updated runtime validation and managed-machine risk items, and revised the ideal user flow to say users install the supported container runtime rather than assuming Docker Desktop.
**Output**: The decision analysis now states that `D-001`, `D-002`, `D-014`, `D-016`, `D-020`, `D-030`, `D-031`, `D-038`, and `D-040` remain the highest-priority explicit sign-off items. The remaining decisions have strong recommendations but still need owner acceptance or implementation lock-in.
**Validation**: `.agent_work` structure validation passed with `python .agent_work\scripts\validate_agent_work.py`.
**Next**: Review the sign-off items with the owner, choose the primary supported runtime-host path before release, and run or defer the Podman compatibility spike before promising Podman support.

### 2026-05-04 - Open-Source GitHub Release Direction Update
**Objective**: Incorporate client feedback requesting an open-source-friendly way for sites to deploy TowerScout from GitHub to local laptops with clear folder and asset guidance.
**Context**: The client feedback changes the preferred release packaging and runtime-host bias, but does not change the underlying need for an OCI-compatible container contract. Reviewer follow-up concluded that Podman is the leading open-source runtime candidate, GitHub Releases should be the user-facing release control plane, and raw source clone/build should remain a developer/support path because TowerScout still depends on large external model and ZIP-code assets.
**Decision**: Keep `TASK-025` OCI-first and engine-aware, make GitHub Releases the preferred end-user delivery path, treat Podman as the leading open-source runtime candidate pending validation, preserve Docker compatibility, and separately track TowerScout application license suitability because selecting Podman does not resolve application licensing questions.
**Execution**: Updated scope assumptions, requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation plan to cover GitHub Release packaging, Podman validation, source-build boundaries, named-volume versus host-visible data profiles, checksummed asset/manual bundle handling, and open-source licensing clarification.
**Output**: `TASK-025` now reflects the newer product direction: GitHub-first release package for normal users, Podman-first candidate after validation, Docker-compatible OCI contract, and deliberate asset/persistence/licensing decisions before release.
**Validation**: Documentation update only; `.agent_work` validation should be rerun after synchronized planning updates.
**Next**: Update synchronized planning surfaces (`current-tasks.md`, `task-backlog.md`, `TASK-054`, and current Sprint 05 status docs), then validate `.agent_work` structure.

### 2026-05-05 - Finalized Pre-Task Decision Lock
**Objective**: Convert the remaining pre-task containerization decision items into an accepted starting contract for `TASK-025`.
**Context**: A follow-up reviewer agreed with the GitHub-first, OCI-compatible approach and recommended a more precise final shape: Podman-first target on Windows after validation, Docker-compatible fallback, GHCR image by digest, GitHub Release ZIP bundle, manifest-managed assets, split CI/release validation, and structured readiness.
**Decision**: Accept the reviewer direction with one adjustment mark: Podman-first is the selected target but remains a release-gated claim until the Windows Podman Desktop / Podman machine compatibility spike passes or is explicitly risk-accepted. This means `TASK-025` can start from an engine-neutral OCI contract, but release docs cannot promise Podman support until validation evidence exists.
**Execution**: Added the finalized pre-task decision set, tightened release-package, readiness, asset, validation, and Podman acceptance language, and kept the application license question separate from runtime/tooling choice.
**Output**: `TASK-025` now has a locked pre-task decision baseline and no longer treats the major decision items as open-ended research questions.
**Validation**: Documentation update only; `.agent_work` validation should be rerun after synchronized planning updates.
**Next**: Update the decision analysis and cross-reference planning docs, then run `.agent_work` structure validation.

### 2026-05-05 - Phase 1 Start
**Objective**: Move `TASK-025` from pre-task decision lock into Phase 1 runtime-contract execution.
**Context**: `TASK-063` is complete with no unresolved risk acceptance required. `TASK-064` is complete and explicitly hands off Docker documentation, container validation, and Windows `test:stage-0` portability follow-up to `TASK-025` or later tooling work. The May 5 decision lock finalized the GitHub-first, OCI-compatible baseline while preserving Podman as a release-gated supported-runtime claim.
**Decision**: Start `TASK-025` Phase 1 by documenting and reconciling the versioned v1 runtime/persistence, asset, health/readiness, release-package, and engine-aware validation contracts before image-definition implementation begins.
**Execution**: Updated the active task status to `IN_PROGRESS - PHASE 1 RUNTIME CONTRACT` and synchronized tracker surfaces to show that pre-container gates are cleared.
**Output**: `TASK-025` is now active in Phase 1. The immediate work is runtime contract inventory and documentation, not yet container file implementation.
**Validation**: Pending `.agent_work` structure validation after tracker updates.
**Next**: Audit runtime paths, assets, config/secret behavior, sessions, logs, uploads, cache/geocode storage, upload limits, and smoke-validation hooks; then write the v1 runtime/persistence contract and container validation checklist.

### 2026-05-05 - Phase 1 Runtime Contract Draft
**Objective**: Convert the initial code audit into a concrete v1 runtime, persistence, asset, readiness, release-package, and validation contract for container implementation.
**Context**: The container task must preserve normalized `webapp/` runtime paths, filesystem sessions, setup/settings config persistence, current upload-limit policy, and the `TASK-052` smoke contract while handling gitignored model/data assets explicitly.
**Decision**: Treat named volumes as the default v1 persistence profile; classify map/geocoding cache as best-effort persisted cache; keep clone/build as developer/support only; split routine CI health/readiness from release-candidate real-asset validation; and require health/readiness plus first-run secret persistence before launcher handoff.
**Execution**:
- Audited `webapp/ts_paths.py`, `webapp/ts_config.py`, `webapp/towerscout.py`, `webapp/ts_yolov5.py`, `webapp/ts_yolov5_local.py`, `webapp/ts_en.py`, `webapp/ts_zipcode.py`, `webapp/ts_geocache.py`, `webapp/ts_logging.py`, `webapp/ts_performance.py`, `webapp/ts_validation.py`, `.gitignore`, `webapp/requirements.txt`, `package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `TASK-052` smoke tests.
- Captured local SHA-256 evidence for the current YOLO, EfficientNet, and ZIP-code assets.
- Created `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-025/TASK-025-V1-RUNTIME-CONTRACT-2026-05-05.md`.
**Output**: Phase 1 now has a concrete contract artifact covering support boundary, runtime path classification, asset inventory/checksum evidence, config/secret-key behavior, readiness states, upload/request-body behavior, cache/geocode durability, release package contents, and CI versus release-candidate validation.
**Validation**: Pending `.agent_work` structure validation after this task-log update.
**Next**: Use the contract to start Phase 2 implementation planning around first-run secret persistence, `/api/health`, `/api/readiness`, asset manifest/preflight, ZIP-code path handling, image definition, and Compose-compatible named volumes.

### 2026-05-05 - App Runtime Contract Implementation Slice
**Objective**: Implement the app-side runtime hooks required before Docker/OCI image and Compose work can rely on stable health, readiness, secret, and data-path behavior.
**Context**: The Phase 1 runtime contract identified four app blockers for containerization: process-local secret-key fallback, missing health/readiness routes, relative ZIP-code data path handling, and lack of focused tests for the new launcher/container status contract.
**Decision**: Implement a small reusable runtime helper module and keep container readiness checks redacted and lightweight. Preserve the `TASK-052` smoke baseline instead of replacing it with a Docker-specific test path.
**Execution**:
- Added `ts_config.ensure_persistent_flask_secret_key()` to create or reuse a stable `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` in `webapp/config/.env`.
- Updated Flask startup to use persistent secret handling outside testing or explicit `TOWERSCOUT_DISABLE_SECRET_PERSISTENCE`.
- Added `webapp/ts_runtime.py` with health/readiness payload helpers, runtime path writability checks, asset presence checks, support metadata, and redacted recovery guidance.
- Added `GET /api/health` and `GET /api/readiness` routes.
- Updated `ts_zipcode.py` to resolve ZIP-code shapefile data from the app base directory instead of relying on process cwd.
- Added focused tests for secret persistence, health/readiness route semantics, readiness redaction/setup-required behavior, and ZIP-code app-anchored path resolution.
**Output**:
- App now exposes cheap liveness and structured readiness for container engines and future launcher polling.
- Empty persistent config can receive a generated secret key before filesystem sessions depend on it.
- ZIP-code data lookup is no longer dependent on launching from `webapp/` as cwd.
**Validation**:
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_config.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py tests\unit\test_runtime_contract.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `27 passed, 8 warnings`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest --collect-only tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `172 tests collected`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\integration\test_end_to_end.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `2 passed, 2 warnings`
- `python .agent_work\scripts\validate_agent_work.py` -> passed
**Next**: Add asset manifest/preflight structure and then start the Docker-compatible image definition plus Compose-compatible named-volume profile.

### 2026-05-05 - Asset Manifest And Preflight Slice
**Objective**: Add the manifest-managed asset contract required for container readiness, release packaging, and routine-CI degraded-mode startup.
**Context**: Large model and ZIP-code assets are gitignored and cannot be assumed present in a clean checkout or routine CI image. `TASK-025` needs a tracked manifest plus runtime preflight reporting before Docker/Compose validation can distinguish missing assets from container regressions.
**Decision**: Track the v1 manifest at `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`, allow override through `TOWERSCOUT_ASSET_MANIFEST`, check file presence and expected byte sizes during readiness, and reserve SHA-256 verification for explicit validation through `TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES=1` or release-candidate tooling so launcher polling does not hash large assets repeatedly.
**Execution**:
- Added `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json` with YOLO, EfficientNet project weights, and ZIP-code shapefile component entries, expected byte sizes, SHA-256 values, source labels, and recovery guidance.
- Added `webapp/ts_assets.py` to load/validate the manifest and report `ok`, `degraded`, or `error` asset state with missing, corrupt, and optional-missing asset lists.
- Updated `webapp/ts_runtime.py` readiness to consume `ts_assets.build_asset_status()`, expose manifest version in readiness, treat manifest errors as `fatal`, and treat missing/corrupt required assets as `degraded`.
- Added `tests/unit/test_assets.py` plus readiness coverage for manifest-error fatal state.
**Output**:
- Routine CI can start without heavyweight assets and receive explicit degraded readiness instead of ambiguous pass/fail behavior.
- Release-candidate validation can enable hash verification against the same manifest.
- Readiness now reports asset manifest version and redacted asset state for launcher/support use.
**Validation**:
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_assets.py tests\unit\test_runtime_contract.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `21 passed`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_assets.py tests\unit\test_config.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py tests\unit\test_runtime_contract.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `33 passed, 8 warnings`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest --collect-only tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `178 tests collected`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\integration\test_end_to_end.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `2 passed, 2 warnings`
- `python .agent_work\scripts\validate_agent_work.py` -> passed
**Next**: Start Docker-compatible image and Compose-compatible named-volume implementation using the established secret, readiness, and asset manifest contracts.

### 2026-05-05 - OCI Image And Compose Baseline Slice
**Objective**: Add the first Docker-compatible / OCI image definition and Compose-compatible named-volume runtime profile on top of the established app runtime contracts.
**Context**: The app now has persistent secret-key handling, health/readiness routes, app-anchored ZIP-code data lookup, and manifest-backed asset preflight. Routine container CI still needs to start without large assets, so container startup must avoid eager ZIP-code/YOLO loading while readiness reports the missing assets as degraded.
**Decision**: Use a multi-stage image with a Node frontend build stage and Python 3.11 slim runtime stage, install CPU PyTorch wheels by default, exclude model/data assets from the image context, and use named volumes for config, assets, logs, sessions/temp/uploads, and cache. Add `TOWERSCOUT_STARTUP_PRELOAD=0` as an explicit container-mode startup switch rather than using the existing `dev` CLI path.
**Execution**:
- Added `Dockerfile` with frontend build, Python runtime dependency install, Waitress app command, healthcheck, and declared runtime volumes.
- Added `.dockerignore` to keep secrets, local runtime state, tests/dev artifacts, and large model/data assets out of image build context.
- Added `compose.yaml` for release-style image runs with named volumes and healthcheck.
- Added `compose.build.yaml` as a developer/support override for local image builds without changing the release-style Compose file.
- Added root `.env.example` for Compose runtime knobs without provider secrets.
- Added `towerscout.should_preload_startup_assets()` and `towerscout.load_model_catalog()` so missing model assets no longer crash asset-light startup when preload is disabled.
- Added focused unit coverage for the startup preload switch and empty model asset volume behavior.
**Output**:
- TowerScout now has an engine-neutral Compose runtime profile with named volumes matching the v1 persistence contract.
- Local developer/support builds can use `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up --build`.
- Release packages can use `compose.yaml` with `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE` set to a pinned GHCR image reference by digest.
- Container startup can serve health/readiness before large assets are present, while readiness remains responsible for reporting degraded asset state.
**Validation**:
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py tests\unit\test_runtime_contract.py tests\unit\test_assets.py tests\unit\test_config.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `35 passed, 8 warnings`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile webapp\towerscout.py webapp\ts_runtime.py webapp\ts_assets.py webapp\ts_config.py` -> passed
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -c "import yaml, pathlib; [yaml.safe_load(pathlib.Path(p).read_text()) for p in ['compose.yaml','compose.build.yaml']] ; print('compose yaml parsed')"` -> `compose yaml parsed`
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml config` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml config` -> passed
- `git diff --check -- Dockerfile .dockerignore compose.yaml compose.build.yaml .env.example webapp\towerscout.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py` -> passed
- `docker build --check -f Dockerfile .` could not be completed locally because Docker Desktop's Linux engine is not running: `failed to connect to the docker API at npipe:////./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine`.
**Next**: Validate a real image build/run when a container engine is available, then prove health/readiness, generated secret persistence, setup/settings persistence, and asset-degraded/real-asset readiness through the container.

### 2026-05-05 - Engine-Aware Release Script Slice
**Objective**: Add the Windows-first helper scripts expected in the GitHub Release ZIP package without hard-coding TowerScout to Docker Desktop.
**Context**: The finalized `TASK-025` direction requires start, stop, logs, and status scripts that can work with Docker or Podman after runtime-host validation. The Compose files now define the common runtime contract, so scripts should be thin wrappers over Compose rather than a separate launcher implementation.
**Decision**: Add PowerShell scripts as the first supported helper surface because v1 targets Windows 11/AMD64. Default engine selection prefers Docker when both commands are present, but each script accepts `-Engine docker` or `-Engine podman` so the Podman spike can validate the same package shape.
**Execution**:
- Added `scripts/lib/TowerScoutCompose.ps1` with shared repo-root, engine discovery, and Compose invocation helpers.
- Added `scripts/start.ps1` with optional `-Build` support for developer/support local builds.
- Added `scripts/stop.ps1`, `scripts/logs.ps1`, and `scripts/status.ps1`.
- Made `status.ps1` call Compose `ps` and then poll `/api/readiness`, returning nonzero for fatal or unreachable readiness.
**Output**:
- The release-package baseline now has Windows-first start/stop/logs/status commands.
- The scripts use the same `compose.yaml` named-volume runtime profile as release runs and can opt into `compose.build.yaml` for local builds.
- The scripts remain engine-aware while Podman remains a release-gated compatibility claim.
**Validation**:
- PowerShell AST parse of `scripts/lib/TowerScoutCompose.ps1`, `scripts/start.ps1`, `scripts/stop.ps1`, `scripts/logs.ps1`, and `scripts/status.ps1` -> passed
- `git diff --check -- scripts Dockerfile .dockerignore compose.yaml compose.build.yaml .env.example webapp\towerscout.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py .agent_work\tasks\active\TASK-025-docker-containerization.md .agent_work\current-tasks.md` -> passed
**Next**: Add user-facing quick-start/runtime documentation and then validate a real container build/run when a Docker or Podman engine is available.

### 2026-05-05 - OCI Quick-Start Documentation Slice
**Objective**: Add release-package documentation outside `.agent_work` so the Compose files and scripts have a user/support-facing operating guide.
**Context**: The GitHub Release ZIP contract requires quick-start guidance, technical runtime-contract documentation, persistence notes, asset handling, engine caveats, and sensitive local data warnings. The task-local runtime contract is useful for implementation evidence, but release packages need concise root-level docs.
**Decision**: Add `docs/oci-quick-start.md` for normal/support operation and `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md` for the technical runtime summary. Keep Podman language release-gated and avoid promising unsupported v1 environments.
**Execution**:
- Created `docs/oci-quick-start.md` covering supported target, package contents, first run, developer build, engine selection, status/logs, named volumes, asset handling, and stop behavior.
- Created `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md` covering startup, health/readiness, writable paths, secret-key persistence, asset checks, upload limit, and CI versus release-candidate validation split.
**Output**:
- Release-package docs now match the engine-aware OCI contract and named-volume Compose profile.
- Sensitive local data surfaces are called out in the user-facing quick start.
**Validation**:
- `python .agent_work\scripts\validate_agent_work.py` -> passed
- `git diff --check -- docs scripts Dockerfile .dockerignore compose.yaml compose.build.yaml .env.example webapp\towerscout.py tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py .agent_work\tasks\active\TASK-025-docker-containerization.md .agent_work\current-tasks.md` -> passed
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py tests\unit\test_runtime_contract.py tests\unit\test_assets.py tests\unit\test_config.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `35 passed, 8 warnings`
**Next**: Run final validation, then continue with real container engine build/run validation when Docker or Podman is available.

### 2026-05-07 - Docker Desktop Build And Runtime Validation
**Objective**: Validate the Docker-compatible image and Compose runtime now that Docker Desktop's Linux engine is available locally.
**Context**: Earlier validation could only run Dockerfile syntax and Compose normalization because Docker Desktop was not running. The owner confirmed Docker Desktop is now up, enabling real image build/start/restart validation.
**Decision**: Validate the source-checkout developer/support path with `compose.build.yaml` and asset-light startup. Keep release-image validation separate because `ghcr.io/towerscout/towerscout:latest` is not published or accessible yet.
**Execution**:
- Ran Dockerfile check.
- Built `towerscout:local` with `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml build towerscout`.
- Started the container with `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d towerscout`.
- Queried `/api/health` and `/api/readiness` on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
- Restarted the container and compared SHA-256 hashes of the persisted `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` line before and after restart without printing the secret.
- Validated `scripts/start.cmd -Engine docker -Build`, `scripts/status.cmd -Engine docker`, `scripts/logs.cmd -Engine docker -Tail 5`, and `scripts/stop.cmd -Engine docker`.
- Added `.cmd` wrappers after direct `.ps1` execution was blocked by the default Windows execution policy.
**Output**:
- Dockerfile check completed with no warnings.
- Local image built successfully as `towerscout:local`.
- Built image ID: `sha256:2c483acc68e6609ceaeb3db79b58ca3906668f71fe4401f251267f91efcab7d5`.
- Built image size: `2798228750` bytes.
- Docker Compose reports `towerscout-towerscout-1` as `healthy` with `0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp`.
- `/api/health` returned `{"service":"towerscout","status":"ok"}`.
- `/api/readiness` returned HTTP 200 with state `setup_required`, `secret_key_persisted: true`, all runtime paths writable, asset manifest version `towerscout-v1-assets-2026-05-05`, and expected missing-asset recovery guidance.
- Persisted secret hash remained stable across restart.
- `status.cmd` prints Compose status and readiness JSON; `logs.cmd` prints recent container logs.
**Validation**:
- `docker build --check -f Dockerfile .` -> passed, no warnings
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml build towerscout` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d towerscout` -> passed
- `curl.exe -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health` -> `{"service":"towerscout","status":"ok"}`
- `curl.exe -s -i http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/readiness` -> HTTP 200, `state: setup_required`, assets `degraded`, config `secret_key_persisted: true`
- Secret persistence check -> `secret_persistence=pass`
- `.\scripts\start.cmd -Engine docker -Build` -> passed
- `.\scripts\status.cmd -Engine docker` -> passed
- `.\scripts\logs.cmd -Engine docker -Tail 5` -> passed
- `.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine docker` -> passed, followed by restart through `start.cmd -Engine docker -Build`
**Issues Identified**:
- Direct `.ps1` helper execution is blocked on this Windows host by execution policy. Remediated by adding `.cmd` wrappers and updating quick-start docs to use them by default.
- `scripts/start.cmd -Engine docker` without `-Build` tries the release-image path and fails until a published/pinned GHCR image exists. This is expected for source checkout validation; release validation remains pending.
- Build output reported existing npm audit findings from the frontend dependency set: one moderate and one high vulnerability. This did not block the image build but should be tracked in dependency/security follow-up.
**Next**: Validate release-image packaging after GHCR publication/pinning, add asset import/bootstrap validation, then run real-asset readiness and detection smoke inside the container.

### 2026-05-07 - Docker Named-Volume Asset Import And Hash Validation
**Objective**: Validate that local release assets can be imported into the Docker named-volume profile and verified by TowerScout readiness.
**Context**: The prior container run proved asset-light startup and degraded readiness. The next gate is proving the same named-volume profile can receive the existing local model and ZIP-code assets, clear the asset-degraded state, and pass SHA-256 verification through the runtime manifest.
**Decision**: Use the existing local `webapp/model_params/` and `webapp/data/` assets as the asset-bundle source for this validation pass. Copy them into the running container's mounted named volumes with `docker compose cp`, then recreate the container once with `TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES=1` to validate endpoint-level hash checks. Return the running container to normal non-hashing readiness afterward so routine status checks stay fast.
**Execution**:
- Confirmed local asset sources exist:
  - `webapp/model_params/yolov5/newest.pt` -> `175084429` bytes
  - `webapp/model_params/EN/b5_unweighted_best.pt` -> `118567303` bytes
  - `webapp/data/tl_2025_us_zcta520/tl_2025_us_zcta520.shp` -> `822559684` bytes
- Copied `webapp/model_params/.` into `/app/webapp/model_params/`.
- Copied `webapp/data/.` into `/app/webapp/data/`.
- Ran in-container manifest preflight without hashes.
- Recreated the container with `TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES=1`.
- Queried `/api/health` and `/api/readiness`.
- Ran explicit in-container `ts_assets.build_asset_status(verify_hashes=True)`.
- Verified the in-container model catalog loads and sees `newest`.
- Recreated the container with `TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES=0` after validation.
**Output**:
- Copied asset footprint inside volumes:
  - `/app/webapp/model_params` -> `281M`
  - `/app/webapp/data` -> `788M`
- In-container asset preflight without hashes returned `ok`, no missing assets, no corrupt assets, no optional missing assets.
- Hash-verified readiness returned:
  - `state: setup_required`
  - `asset_status: ok`
  - `verify_hashes: true`
  - `missing: []`
  - `corrupt: []`
  - `optional_missing: []`
  - `secret_key_persisted: true`
  - `manifest: towerscout-v1-assets-2026-05-05`
- Explicit in-container hash verification returned `ok`, `verify_hashes: True`, no missing/corrupt/optional-missing assets.
- `towerscout.load_model_catalog()` returned `True` and model catalog keys included `newest`.
- After returning to normal readiness mode, the container remained healthy and readiness reported `asset_status: ok`, `verify_hashes: false`, no missing/corrupt assets.
**Validation**:
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml cp webapp/model_params/. towerscout:/app/webapp/model_params/` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml cp webapp/data/. towerscout:/app/webapp/data/` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout python -c "import ts_assets; s=ts_assets.build_asset_status(verify_hashes=False); ..."` -> `ok`, `[]`, `[]`, `[]`
- `TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES=1 docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --force-recreate towerscout` -> passed
- `GET /api/health` -> `{"service":"towerscout","status":"ok"}`
- Hash-verified `GET /api/readiness` -> assets `ok`, no missing/corrupt assets, secret persisted
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout python -c "import ts_assets; s=ts_assets.build_asset_status(verify_hashes=True); ..."` -> `ok`, `True`, `[]`, `[]`, `[]`
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout python -c "import towerscout; print(towerscout.load_model_catalog()); print(sorted(towerscout.engines.keys()))"` -> `True`, `['newest']`
- `TOWERSCOUT_VERIFY_ASSET_HASHES=0 docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --force-recreate towerscout` -> passed
**Issues Identified**:
- This validates manual/local asset import into named volumes, not a packaged download/bootstrap script yet.
- Readiness still reports `setup_required` because provider configuration has not been saved in the container. This is expected and will be the next persistence validation slice.
**Next**: Validate Setup Wizard/Settings persistence across container restart, then run a containerized `TASK-052` smoke path with real assets present.

### 2026-05-07 - Settings Persistence And Google TLS Finding
**Objective**: Validate saved provider configuration persistence across container restart and investigate Google key validation failure in the container.
**Context**: The owner entered an Azure Maps key through the containerized UI and confirmed it worked. Google key validation returned `502 BAD GATEWAY` with the UI message `Could not reach the provider validation service.`
**Decision**: Use the saved Azure configuration to validate Setup/Settings persistence without printing secret values. Treat the Google failure as a container TLS trust issue rather than a key-validity issue, because the failure occurs before Google can evaluate the key.
**Execution**:
- Inspected container logs for the failed Google validation.
- Tested Google HTTPS reachability from inside the container without an API key.
- Compared certifi and system CA bundle behavior from inside the container.
- Patched log and structured-error sanitization to prevent provider keys from leaking through exception tracebacks or API error payload causes.
- Added Compose environment support and docs for `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, and last-resort `TOWERSCOUT_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS`.
- Added `.cmd`/docs support earlier remains the Windows-first helper path.
- Rebuilt and restarted `towerscout:local`.
- Triggered a fake Google-shaped key validation failure and scanned recent logs for the fake key.
- Restarted the container and verified the saved Azure key line stayed stable by SHA-256 hash without printing the key.
**Output**:
- Google validation failure root cause: TLS verification failure contacting `maps.googleapis.com`: `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: unable to get local issuer certificate`.
- The same TLS failure occurs without a key and with both certifi and `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`, which points to a host/network TLS inspection CA not trusted by the container rather than an invalid Google key.
- Raw provider-key leakage through exception tracebacks was fixed and validated with a fake key.
- Azure provider configuration persisted across container restart.
- After restart, readiness reported:
  - `state: ready`
  - `assets: ok`
  - `azure_configured: true`
  - `google_configured: false`
  - `secret_key_persisted: true`
**Validation**:
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_logging_sanitization.py tests\unit\test_error_sanitization.py tests\unit\test_config.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `23 passed, 9 warnings, 5 subtests passed`
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_logging_sanitization.py tests\unit\test_error_sanitization.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `11 passed, 1 warning, 5 subtests passed`
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --build --force-recreate towerscout` -> passed
- Fake Google key validation failure log scan -> `fake_key_not_found_in_recent_logs`
- Azure persistence restart check -> `azure_hash_stable: true`, `readiness_state: ready`, `assets: ok`, `azure_configured: true`, `secret_key_persisted: true`
**Issues Identified**:
- A real Google key was attempted before the redaction fix, so the operator should rotate that Google key if there is any chance the container logs are retained or shared.
- Google validation remains blocked in this Docker environment until the local TLS inspection/root CA is trusted in the container or an explicit insecure validation workaround is enabled.
- `TOWERSCOUT_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1` should be treated only as a local validation fallback, not the release default.
**Next**: Add or validate a documented local CA import procedure if Google validation is required in this environment; otherwise proceed with containerized `TASK-052` smoke using the validated Azure configuration and real assets.

### 2026-05-07 - Containerized TASK-052 Smoke Validation
**Objective**: Run the maintained `TASK-052` bounded detection-readiness smoke inside the Docker container with real assets present.
**Context**: Docker named-volume asset import is validated, Azure configuration persists, and readiness is `ready`. The next validation gate is proving the containerized app can load the real local YOLO runtime and reach the expected controlled imagery-failure boundary.
**Decision**: Add a reusable `scripts/validate_container_task052_smoke.py` helper that mirrors the host-side `TASK-052` smoke while executing inside the built image. Copy it into the running container for validation rather than baking test code into the release image.
**Execution**:
- Added `scripts/validate_container_task052_smoke.py`.
- Ran local syntax validation for the script.
- Copied the script into the running container at `/tmp/validate_container_task052_smoke.py`.
- Executed it from `/app/webapp` with `PYTHONPATH=/app/webapp`.
- Verified readiness and Docker health after the smoke.
**Output**:
- The first execution attempt failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'towerscout'` because Python used `/tmp` as the import root. Re-running with `PYTHONPATH=/app/webapp` fixed the validation harness path without changing app behavior.
- The smoke loaded the real container-mounted YOLO model at `/app/webapp/model_params/yolov5/newest.pt`.
- The app reached the expected controlled imagery failure boundary and returned `502`.
- Progress title was `Imagery download failed`.
- Container remained healthy afterward.
- Readiness after the smoke remained `ready`, assets `ok`, Azure configured, persisted secret present, no missing/corrupt assets.
**Validation**:
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile scripts\validate_container_task052_smoke.py` -> passed
- `git diff --check -- scripts\validate_container_task052_smoke.py` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml cp scripts/validate_container_task052_smoke.py towerscout:/tmp/validate_container_task052_smoke.py` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout sh -c "cd /app/webapp && PYTHONPATH=/app/webapp python /tmp/validate_container_task052_smoke.py"` -> passed
- Smoke output:
  - `container_task052_smoke=pass`
  - `engine_id=newest`
  - `model_path=/app/webapp/model_params/yolov5/newest.pt`
  - `response_status=502`
  - `progress_title=Imagery download failed`
- Post-smoke readiness -> `state: ready`, `assets: ok`, `azure_configured: true`, `secret_key_persisted: true`, no missing/corrupt assets
- Post-smoke Docker status -> container `healthy`
**Issues Identified**:
- Initial smoke validation surfaced an Ultralytics warning because `/root/.config/Ultralytics` was not writable. Remediated by setting `YOLO_CONFIG_DIR=/app/webapp/cache/ultralytics` in the image and Compose profile and ensuring that directory exists at app startup.
**Next**: Continue with packaged asset bootstrap/import scripting and release-image/GHCR validation.

### 2026-05-07 - YOLO Config Directory Container Fix
**Objective**: Remove the non-blocking Ultralytics first-run config warning from containerized model-load validation.
**Context**: The containerized `TASK-052` smoke passed, but Ultralytics warned that its default config path was unwritable and fell back to `/tmp/Ultralytics`.
**Decision**: Persist Ultralytics config under the existing cache volume rather than leaving it in `/tmp` or adding a new persistence surface.
**Execution**:
- Added `YOLO_CONFIG_DIR=/app/webapp/cache/ultralytics` to the Dockerfile environment.
- Added `YOLO_CONFIG_DIR` to `compose.yaml` and `.env.example`.
- Documented the setting in `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md`.
- Added `towerscout.ensure_yolo_config_dir()` and a focused unit test so the configured directory is created before model loading.
- Rebuilt and restarted the container.
- Re-ran the containerized `TASK-052` smoke and failed the command if the prior unwritable-config warning appeared.
**Output**:
- Re-run smoke passed with `container_task052_smoke=pass`.
- Ultralytics created settings at `/app/webapp/cache/ultralytics/Ultralytics/settings.json`.
- The prior `user config directory ... is not writable` warning did not recur.
- Post-smoke readiness remained `ready`, assets `ok`, Azure configured, and secret persisted.
**Validation**:
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `16 passed`
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --build --force-recreate towerscout` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout sh -c "cd /app/webapp && PYTHONPATH=/app/webapp python /tmp/validate_container_task052_smoke.py"` -> passed, no unwritable-config warning
- Post-smoke readiness -> `state: ready`, `assets: ok`, `azure_configured: true`, `secret_key_persisted: true`
**Next**: Continue with packaged asset bootstrap/import scripting, release-image/GHCR validation, and Podman compatibility work.

### 2026-05-07 - Packaged Asset Import Helper
**Objective**: Add and validate a release-package helper for importing model and ZIP-code assets into the Compose named-volume profile.
**Context**: Manual `docker compose cp` asset import was validated earlier, but `TASK-025` requires a packaged path normal users/support staff can run from a GitHub Release ZIP. The expected release bundle layout is `assets/model_params/` and `assets/data/`.
**Decision**: Add a Windows-first `import-assets` helper that starts the service if needed, copies asset directories into the running service's mounted volumes, and verifies the runtime manifest in-container. Keep SHA-256 verification optional because it is appropriate for release/support validation but expensive for routine use.
**Execution**:
- Added `scripts/import-assets.ps1`.
- Added `scripts/import-assets.cmd` so Windows users are not blocked by PowerShell execution policy.
- Updated `docs/oci-quick-start.md` and `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md` with asset bundle layout and import commands.
- Validated PowerShell parsing.
- Ran the helper against the current source-checkout asset layout with `-Source webapp -Engine docker -Build -VerifyHashes`.
**Output**:
- The import helper copied `webapp/model_params/.` to `/app/webapp/model_params/`.
- The import helper copied `webapp/data/.` to `/app/webapp/data/`.
- In-container manifest verification returned:
  - `asset_status=ok`
  - `verify_hashes=True`
  - `missing=`
  - `corrupt=`
  - `optional_missing=`
- Readiness after import remained `ready`, assets `ok`, Azure configured, secret persisted, and no missing/corrupt assets.
**Validation**:
- PowerShell AST parse of helper scripts -> passed
- `git diff --check -- scripts\import-assets.ps1 scripts\import-assets.cmd docs\oci-quick-start.md docs\oci-runtime-contract.md` -> passed
- `.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source webapp -Engine docker -Build -VerifyHashes` -> passed
- `GET /api/readiness` after import -> `state: ready`, `assets: ok`, `azure_configured: true`, `secret_key_persisted: true`, no missing/corrupt assets
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout sh -c "test -f /app/webapp/cache/ultralytics/Ultralytics/settings.json && echo yolo_config_present"` -> `yolo_config_present`
**Issues Identified**:
- This provides local/release-folder import, not a network downloader. If assets are hosted externally, a future helper still needs download, checksum, and staged activation behavior.
**Next**: Continue with release-image/GHCR digest validation and Podman compatibility spike, or add a network asset downloader if the release process requires direct object-storage/bootstrap support.

### 2026-05-07 - Local Release Package Assembly Helper
**Objective**: Add and validate the GitHub Release control-package assembly path without requiring GHCR credentials or a published release image.
**Context**: The release package contract requires a ZIP containing Compose runtime files, `.env` template, Windows helper wrappers, docs, asset manifest metadata, checksums, and a pinned image reference. The actual GHCR image digest is not available yet, so this slice validates package assembly and marks digest pinning as the remaining release-image gate.
**Decision**: Add a Windows-first `package-release` helper that stages only release-control-plane files and writes image metadata/checksums. Keep large model/data assets out of the ZIP and include an `assets/README.txt` placeholder for the separate asset bundle layout.
**Execution**:
- Added `scripts/package-release.ps1`.
- Added `scripts/package-release.cmd` to avoid Windows PowerShell execution-policy friction.
- Updated `docs/oci-quick-start.md` and `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md` with package contents, maintainer command, `IMAGE.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and ZIP checksum behavior.
- Validated PowerShell parsing for the package helper and existing helper scripts.
- Built a local package under `.agent_work/pytest-temp/release-package/` using `-Image towerscout:local`.
- Verified required package files, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, ZIP creation, and `.zip.sha256` creation.
**Output**:
- The package helper stages:
  - `compose.yaml`
  - `.env.example`
  - `docs/oci-quick-start.md`
  - `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md`
  - `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`
  - `scripts/lib/TowerScoutCompose.ps1`
  - `scripts/start|stop|logs|status|import-assets` `.cmd` and `.ps1` helpers
  - `assets/README.txt`
  - `IMAGE.txt`
  - `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- Local validation produced `towerscout-task025-local-20260507114315.zip` plus `towerscout-task025-local-20260507114315.zip.sha256` in scratch space.
- `IMAGE.txt` recorded `Image: towerscout:local` and an empty digest, correctly marking the package as local-validation only.
**Validation**:
- PowerShell AST parse of `scripts/package-release.ps1` and helper scripts -> passed
- `git diff --check -- scripts\package-release.ps1 scripts\package-release.cmd docs\oci-quick-start.md docs\oci-runtime-contract.md` -> passed
- `.\scripts\package-release.cmd -Version task025-local-20260507114315 -Image towerscout:local -OutputDir .agent_work\pytest-temp\release-package` -> passed
- Required package file verification -> passed
- Package ZIP and `.zip.sha256` verification -> passed
**Issues Identified**:
- This validates release control-package assembly, not registry publication.
- Release-image validation remains blocked until a GHCR image exists and can be referenced by immutable digest.
- Optional OCI image archive packaging is still a documented fallback concept, not implemented in this helper.
**Next**: Continue with GHCR image publication/digest validation when credentials and repository target are available, or run the Podman compatibility spike if Podman is installed and configured.

### 2026-05-07 - Windows Podman Runtime Compatibility Spike
**Objective**: Validate the TowerScout Compose/runtime contract against the installed Windows Podman WSL engine without relying on a published GHCR image.
**Context**: `TASK-025` requires Podman Desktop / Podman machine validation or explicit risk acceptance before Podman is promised as the supported open-source runtime. Docker Desktop is also installed on this host, so the spike needed to distinguish the Podman engine result from the Compose-provider dependency.
**Decision**: Reuse the already-built `towerscout:local` image by exporting it from Docker and loading it into Podman. Run the release-style Compose profile through `scripts/start.cmd -Engine podman` on port `5001` to avoid the active Docker validation service on port `5000`. Validate asset-light startup, named volumes, asset import, readiness, and the maintained containerized `TASK-052` smoke.
**Execution**:
- Confirmed Podman is installed at `C:\Users\bg90\AppData\Local\Programs\Podman\podman.exe`.
- Started `podman-machine-default`, a rootless WSL machine.
- Verified the Docker-compatible API path through `npipe:////./pipe/podman-machine-default`.
- Exported `towerscout:local` from Docker to a scratch tar and loaded it into Podman.
- Started TowerScout with `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE=towerscout:local`, `TOWERSCOUT_PORT=5001`, `TOWERSCOUT_CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`, and `.\scripts\start.cmd -Engine podman`.
- Queried health/readiness and checked the runtime reported `container_engine: podman`.
- Ran `.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source webapp -Engine podman -VerifyHashes`.
- Copied and ran `scripts/validate_container_task052_smoke.py` inside the Podman container.
- Stopped the Podman Compose project and removed the scratch image-transfer tar.
**Output**:
- Podman client: `5.8.2`, Windows/AMD64.
- Podman server: `5.8.2`, Linux/AMD64 on WSL2.
- Podman machine: rootless WSL, user-mode networking, API forwarding on `npipe:////./pipe/podman-machine-default`.
- `podman compose` worked, but delegated to Docker Desktop's bundled `docker-compose.exe`; Podman sets up the provider to talk to the Podman socket.
- Asset-light Podman startup succeeded on `http://127.0.0.1:5001`.
- Readiness returned `state: setup_required`, expected asset-degraded recovery guidance, persisted secret present, and writable runtime paths.
- Podman asset import returned `asset_status=ok`, `verify_hashes=True`, no missing/corrupt/optional-missing assets.
- Containerized `TASK-052` smoke passed in Podman:
  - `container_task052_smoke=pass`
  - `engine_id=newest`
  - `model_path=/app/webapp/model_params/yolov5/newest.pt`
  - `response_status=502`
  - `progress_title=Imagery download failed`
**Validation**:
- `podman machine start podman-machine-default` -> passed
- `docker --host npipe:////./pipe/podman-machine-default version` -> passed against Podman server
- `podman load -i .agent_work\pytest-temp\podman-image-transfer\towerscout-local.tar` -> loaded `docker.io/library/towerscout:local`
- `.\scripts\start.cmd -Engine podman` with `TOWERSCOUT_PORT=5001` -> passed
- `GET /api/health` on port `5001` -> `{"service":"towerscout","status":"ok"}`
- `GET /api/readiness` on port `5001` -> setup-required/degraded asset-light state with writable paths and persisted secret
- `.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source webapp -Engine podman -VerifyHashes` -> passed
- `podman compose -f compose.yaml exec -T towerscout sh -c "cd /app/webapp && PYTHONPATH=/app/webapp python /tmp/validate_container_task052_smoke.py"` -> passed
- `.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine podman` -> passed
**Issues Identified**:
- This validates the Podman engine path on a host that also has Docker Desktop installed.
- `podman compose` used Docker Desktop's bundled `docker-compose.exe` as the external Compose provider. A follow-up should test the same Podman path while the Docker Desktop engine is stopped, and a Docker-Desktop-free Podman release path still needs validation with `podman-compose` or another approved Compose provider.
- This spike reused an image transferred from Docker rather than pulling a published GHCR image by digest.
- Podman provider setup persisted assets in Podman named volumes; volumes were intentionally not deleted after the spike.
**Next**: Validate GHCR pull-by-digest under Docker and Podman after image publication; separately validate Podman with the Docker Desktop engine stopped and validate a Docker-Desktop-free Podman Compose provider before promising Podman as the normal open-source runtime.

### 2026-05-07 - Google TLS Inspection CA Import Validation
**Objective**: Validate the secure Google provider TLS fix for the containerized app behind local TLS inspection without disabling certificate verification.
**Context**: Google key validation previously failed with `502 BAD GATEWAY` and container logs showed `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` for `maps.googleapis.com`. A peer-certificate probe inside the container showed Google traffic was being intercepted by Zscaler and issued by the CDC `CDC-G2-ZSH` certificate chain.
**Decision**: Add a release/support helper that imports a Windows CA certificate by thumbprint or a PEM/CER/CRT file into the persistent config volume, builds a combined CA bundle from the container's default Debian bundle plus the local CA chain, and verifies Google TLS with an invalid test key. Keep `TOWERSCOUT_ALLOW_INSECURE_TLS=1` as a last-resort local validation fallback only.
**Execution**:
- Confirmed the baseline container still failed Google HTTPS with `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` using `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`.
- Inspected the peer certificate inside the container with `openssl s_client`.
- Identified the intercepted Google certificate as `subject=CN = upload.video.google.com, O = Zscaler Inc., OU = Zscaler Inc.` with issuer `CDC-G2-ZSH`.
- Located `CDC-G2-ZSH` in the Windows certificate store with thumbprint `C69667336E90D872FA44ACE4EB25412E52F406B9`.
- Added `scripts/import-tls-ca.ps1` and `scripts/import-tls-ca.cmd`.
- Updated the helper after validation exposed two issues:
  - initial shell quoting for inline Python verification was fragile through Windows Compose
  - importing only `CDC-G2-ZSH` was insufficient because the container also needed the `CDC-G2` issuer
- Updated the helper to run verification without shell quoting and to include the Windows certificate chain for thumbprint imports.
- Imported the CDC/Zscaler CA chain into `/app/webapp/config/certs/local-ca.pem` and built `/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`.
- Recreated the Docker container with `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem` and `SSL_CERT_FILE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`.
- Posted an intentionally invalid Google key to TowerScout's `/api/config/validate-key` endpoint to prove provider validation now reaches Google.
- Owner re-entered the real Google key through the containerized UI after the CA bundle fix.
**Output**:
- CA helper verification returned:
  - `google_tls_status=200`
  - `google_tls_body={ "error_message" : "The provided API key is invalid. ", "results" : [], ... }`
- TowerScout validation endpoint returned HTTP `200` with:
  - `valid: false`
  - `provider: google`
  - `message: Google Maps validation failed with status 403.`
- The result confirms the failure mode changed from network/TLS `502` to normal provider invalid-key handling.
- Owner confirmed real Google key entry worked in the UI after the CA bundle fix.
**Validation**:
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout python -c "...requests.get('https://maps.googleapis.com/...')"` before CA import -> reproduced `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml exec -T towerscout sh -c "echo | openssl s_client ..."` -> identified Zscaler/CDC certificate issuer
- Windows certificate-store lookup for `CDC-G2-ZSH` -> found thumbprint `C69667336E90D872FA44ACE4EB25412E52F406B9`
- PowerShell AST parse of `scripts/import-tls-ca.ps1` -> passed
- `.\scripts\import-tls-ca.cmd -Engine docker -Thumbprint C69667336E90D872FA44ACE4EB25412E52F406B9` -> passed after chain-export fix
- Container recreate with combined CA bundle environment variables -> passed
- `POST /api/config/validate-key` with invalid Google test key -> HTTP `200`, provider-level invalid-key response, no `502`
- Owner UI validation with real Google key after CA bundle fix -> passed
**Issues Identified**:
- The helper currently imports and verifies the CA bundle but does not edit `.env`; release/support docs instruct operators to set `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` to the combined bundle path and recreate the container.
- Real Google key validation through the UI now succeeds after the CA bundle import and container recreate.
**Next**: Persist the combined CA bundle path in the release `.env` or support environment so the Google TLS fix survives future container recreates. Continue GHCR image digest validation when a published image target is available.

### 2026-05-07 - GHCR Publish Workflow And Digest Package Preparation
**Objective**: Prepare the GHCR image publication and digest-pinned release-package path, then assess what blocks real digest validation from this workstation.
**Context**: The release package contract requires a pinned GHCR image digest. The existing CI only builds a local Docker image on `main` and does not publish a container image. The repo remote is `https://github.com/J-Schulein/TowerScout.git`, so the concrete GHCR target should be `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout`.
**Decision**: Add a manual GHCR publish workflow with `packages: write`, align Compose/release defaults with `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout`, and validate that `package-release` can generate digest-pinned package metadata locally. Treat real GHCR pull-by-digest validation as blocked until the workflow is pushed/run or package-scoped credentials are available.
**Execution**:
- Checked repository remote and branch.
- Checked GHCR manifests for `ghcr.io/towerscout/towerscout:latest` and `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout:latest`.
- Checked GitHub CLI authentication scope.
- Added `.github/workflows/container-publish.yml` as a manual `workflow_dispatch` publisher.
- Updated `compose.yaml`, `.env.example`, `scripts/package-release.ps1`, `docs/oci-quick-start.md`, and `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md` to use `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout`.
- Ran `package-release` with a placeholder digest to validate pinned metadata output.
**Output**:
- `docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/towerscout/towerscout:latest` -> `denied`
- `docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout:latest` -> `denied`
- `gh auth status` shows account `J-Schulein` is logged in, but available token scopes are `gist`, `read:org`, `repo`, and `workflow`; package scopes are not present.
- Manual workflow target:
  - image: `ghcr.io/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY,,}`
  - concrete repo target: `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout`
  - platform: `linux/amd64`
  - output: `image-metadata.json` artifact plus digest reference in the workflow summary
- Local package validation with placeholder digest produced:
  - `Image: ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout@sha256:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
  - `.env.example` with `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE=ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout@sha256:...`
  - `.env.example` with `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE_DIGEST=sha256:...`
  - release package includes `scripts/import-tls-ca.cmd` and `scripts/import-tls-ca.ps1`
**Validation**:
- PowerShell AST parse of `scripts/import-tls-ca.ps1` and `scripts/package-release.ps1` -> passed
- `git diff --check -- .github\workflows\container-publish.yml compose.yaml .env.example scripts\package-release.ps1 scripts\import-tls-ca.ps1 scripts\import-tls-ca.cmd docs\oci-quick-start.md docs\oci-runtime-contract.md .agent_work\tasks\active\TASK-025-docker-containerization.md .agent_work\current-tasks.md` -> passed
- `.\scripts\package-release.cmd -Version task025-ghcr-local-20260507121903 -Image ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout -ImageDigest sha256:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa -OutputDir .agent_work\pytest-temp\release-package` -> passed
- Package required-file check for `scripts\import-tls-ca.cmd`, `scripts\import-tls-ca.ps1`, `IMAGE.txt`, `.env.example`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` -> passed
**Issues Identified**:
- Real GHCR digest validation is still blocked locally because no accessible image manifest exists yet and the current GitHub CLI token does not show package scopes.
- The publish workflow must be pushed and run, or an appropriately scoped GHCR token must be provided, before `docker pull ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout@sha256:<digest>` and release-image Compose validation can be completed.
**Next**: After publishing, validate Docker and Podman pull-by-digest paths and regenerate the release ZIP with the real digest. Continue real Google UI key validation after persisting the trusted CA bundle env vars.

### 2026-05-07 - Local Compose CA Bundle Persistence
**Objective**: Persist the validated TLS CA bundle configuration for local Docker Compose restarts without storing provider secrets in the repo.
**Context**: The containerized Google validation path worked after importing the CDC/Zscaler CA chain and recreating the container with `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` / `SSL_CERT_FILE` set to `/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`. The remaining local risk was that a later Compose recreate would fall back to the default Debian bundle unless the setting was persisted outside the one-off shell environment.
**Decision**: Create a local, git-ignored `.env` containing non-secret Compose/runtime settings only. Keep provider API keys in the container's persistent `webapp/config/.env` volume through Setup Wizard/Settings.
**Execution**:
- Confirmed repo-root `.env` did not exist and is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Added local `.env` with:
  - `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE=towerscout:local`
  - `TOWERSCOUT_CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker`
  - `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`
  - `SSL_CERT_FILE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`
  - non-secret runtime defaults
- Updated `.env.example` comments to point at the combined CA bundle path produced by `scripts/import-tls-ca.cmd`.
- Recreated the Docker container with `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --force-recreate towerscout` without ad hoc CA environment variables.
- Verified the recreated container inherited the CA bundle paths from local `.env`.
- Queried readiness and the Google validation endpoint after recreate.
**Output**:
- Recreated container environment includes:
  - `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`
  - `SSL_CERT_FILE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`
  - `TOWERSCOUT_CONTAINER_ENGINE=docker`
- Readiness after recreate returned:
  - `state: ready`
  - assets `ok`
  - `azure.configured: true`
  - `google.configured: true`
  - `secret_key_persisted: true`
- Invalid Google test-key validation returned HTTP `200` with provider-level invalid-key response, not TLS/network `502`.
**Validation**:
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d --force-recreate towerscout` -> passed using local `.env`
- In-container env check for `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`, `SSL_CERT_FILE`, and `TOWERSCOUT_CONTAINER_ENGINE` -> passed
- `GET /api/readiness` -> `ready`, assets `ok`, Azure configured, Google configured, persisted secret present
- `POST /api/config/validate-key` with invalid Google test key -> HTTP `200`, `valid: false`, `message: Google Maps validation failed with status 403.`
**Issues Identified**:
- Local `.env` is intentionally ignored and should not be committed.
- Release packages still need users/operators to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the CA bundle path after running `import-tls-ca.cmd` when their network performs TLS inspection.
**Next**: Continue with GHCR publish/digest validation when the workflow is available on GitHub, or proceed to Podman-with-Docker-engine-stopped validation if we want to advance the remaining local runtime gate first.

### 2026-05-07 - Podman Docker-Engine-Stopped Validation Attempt
**Objective**: Test whether the Podman Compose path works while the Docker Desktop engine is stopped.
**Context**: The prior Podman spike proved the TowerScout runtime works on the Podman WSL engine, but `podman compose` delegated to Docker Desktop's bundled `docker-compose.exe`. The next question was whether that Compose provider can still drive Podman when the Docker daemon itself is unavailable.
**Decision**: Stop the Docker Compose TowerScout service, terminate the `docker-desktop` WSL distro, start Podman, and run `scripts/start.cmd -Engine podman` on port `5001`. Treat the validation as passing only if Docker daemon access is unavailable while Podman Compose still starts TowerScout.
**Execution**:
- Confirmed `podman-compose` is not installed.
- Stopped the current Docker TowerScout container with `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml stop towerscout`.
- Ran `wsl --terminate docker-desktop`.
- Started `podman-machine-default`.
- Ran `docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'` to verify Docker daemon unavailability.
- Ran `.\scripts\start.cmd -Engine podman` with `TOWERSCOUT_IMAGE=towerscout:local`, `TOWERSCOUT_PORT=5001`, and `TOWERSCOUT_CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman`.
- Checked WSL running distributions and Podman readiness.
- Stopped the Podman Compose project and stopped the Podman machine.
- Attempted to restart the Docker TowerScout container.
**Output**:
- `podman-compose` was not found on PATH.
- `wsl --terminate docker-desktop` completed successfully, but `docker version` still returned server version `29.4.1`.
- `wsl --list --running` showed `docker-desktop` running again during the validation, along with Podman WSL distributions.
- Podman Compose start on port `5001` succeeded and readiness showed:
  - `runtime.container_engine: podman`
  - assets `ok`
  - writable runtime paths
  - state `setup_required` because this used Podman volumes, not the Docker config volume with saved provider keys
- The attempt is inconclusive for the Docker-engine-stopped gate because Docker Desktop restarted or stayed reachable.
- Restarting the Docker TowerScout container failed because Docker Desktop reported: `Docker Desktop is manually paused. Unpause it through the Whale menu or Dashboard.`
- After the owner unpaused/restarted Docker Desktop, the Docker TowerScout container restarted successfully on port `5000`.
**Validation**:
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml stop towerscout` -> passed
- `wsl --terminate docker-desktop` -> passed
- `docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'` after termination -> returned `29.4.1`, so Docker daemon was still reachable
- `.\scripts\start.cmd -Engine podman` with `TOWERSCOUT_PORT=5001` -> passed
- `.\scripts\status.cmd -Engine podman` -> passed with Podman readiness output
- `.\scripts\stop.cmd -Engine podman` -> passed
- `podman machine stop podman-machine-default` -> passed
- `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d towerscout` -> blocked by Docker Desktop paused state
- After Docker Desktop was unpaused, `docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.build.yaml up -d towerscout` -> passed
- Restored Docker readiness -> `state: ready`, assets `ok`, Azure configured, Google configured, persisted secret present
- Restored Docker env check -> `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`, `SSL_CERT_FILE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem`
**Issues Identified**:
- This does not close the Docker-engine-stopped gate because Docker daemon access remained available after attempting to stop `docker-desktop`.
- Docker Desktop had to be unpaused in the UI before the Docker validation service could be restarted.
- A stronger follow-up should use a machine where Docker Desktop is fully quit/uninstalled or use a validated non-Docker Compose provider such as `podman-compose`.
**Next**: Keep the Docker-engine-stopped and Docker-Desktop-free Podman Compose-provider checks open; rerun on a host where Docker Desktop can be fully quit or unavailable without auto-restarting.

## Validation Results

### Current Validation Summary

**Last Updated**: 2026-05-07

**Validated**:
- App-side runtime contract: persistent first-run `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`, `/api/health`, `/api/readiness`, app-anchored ZIP-code path lookup, asset manifest/preflight, and redacted readiness details.
- Local Docker Desktop build path: `Dockerfile` check, local image build, Compose startup, Docker healthcheck, HTTP health/readiness, and restart persistence.
- Default named-volume runtime profile through `compose.yaml`.
- Developer/support local build override through `compose.build.yaml`.
- Windows helper script path through `.cmd` wrappers: `start.cmd -Build`, `status.cmd`, `logs.cmd`, and `stop.cmd`.
- Release-package documentation baseline through `docs/oci-quick-start.md` and `docs/oci-runtime-contract.md`.
- Local GitHub Release control-package assembly through `scripts/package-release.cmd`, including package staging, `IMAGE.txt`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, ZIP creation, and ZIP checksum output.
- Windows Podman WSL runtime spike: Podman engine startup, named volumes, asset-light readiness, asset import, and containerized `TASK-052` smoke.
- Podman Docker-engine-stopped validation attempt: Podman runtime still started, but the gate remains inconclusive because Docker Desktop restarted/stayed reachable and later reported manually paused. Docker service was restored after the owner unpaused Docker Desktop.
- Google TLS inspection CA import path: Windows CA thumbprint export with chain, combined container CA bundle, and TowerScout Google validation endpoint reaching provider-level invalid-key response instead of TLS `502`.
- Local `.env` persistence for the combined TLS CA bundle path, validated across Docker Compose recreate.
- GHCR publish preparation: manual workflow added for `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout`, Compose/release defaults aligned, and digest-pinned package metadata validated with a placeholder digest.

- Podman `GET /api/health` -> `{"service":"towerscout","status":"ok"}`.
- Podman `GET /api/readiness` asset-light state -> `setup_required`, assets `degraded`, writable paths, persisted secret.
- `.\scripts\import-assets.cmd -Source webapp -Engine podman -VerifyHashes` -> passed with `asset_status=ok`.
- Podman containerized `TASK-052` smoke -> passed with real model load and expected controlled imagery failure.
- Podman Docker-engine-stopped attempt -> inconclusive; `docker version` still returned `29.4.1` after `wsl --terminate docker-desktop`, Docker Desktop later reported manually paused, and Docker service was restored after owner unpause.
- Baseline in-container Google HTTPS probe before CA import -> reproduced `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`.
- `.\scripts\import-tls-ca.cmd -Engine docker -Thumbprint C69667336E90D872FA44ACE4EB25412E52F406B9` -> passed after chain-export fix, Google TLS returned provider invalid-key JSON.
- Docker container recreate with `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem` and `SSL_CERT_FILE=/app/webapp/config/certs/towerscout-ca-bundle.pem` -> passed.
- `POST /api/config/validate-key` with invalid Google test key -> HTTP `200`, `valid: false`, `message: Google Maps validation failed with status 403.`
- Real Google key entry through containerized UI after CA bundle fix -> passed per owner validation.
- Local `.env` recreate proof -> passed; readiness `ready`, assets `ok`, Azure configured, Google configured, persisted secret present, and Google invalid-key probe returned provider-level `403` handling.
- GHCR manifest probes for `ghcr.io/towerscout/towerscout:latest` and `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout:latest` -> `denied`.
- `gh auth status` -> logged in as `J-Schulein`, but token scopes do not include package scopes.
- Manual GHCR publish workflow added at `.github/workflows/container-publish.yml`.
- Digest-pinned release package dry run with `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout@sha256:aaaaaaaa...` -> passed.
- `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests\unit\test_flask_routes.py tests\unit\test_runtime_contract.py tests\unit\test_assets.py tests\unit\test_config.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `35 passed, 8 warnings`.
- `python .agent_work\scripts\validate_agent_work.py` -> passed.

**Findings**:
- Direct `.ps1` helper execution is blocked by the default Windows execution policy on this host. This is remediated by `.cmd` wrappers and quick-start updates that use the wrappers by default.
- The release-image path is not validated yet because `ghcr.io/towerscout/towerscout:latest` is not published or accessible. Source checkout validation uses `start.cmd -Build` and `compose.build.yaml`.
- Asset-light startup behaves correctly: the container serves setup and readiness without model/ZIP assets, and readiness reports assets as degraded with recovery guidance.
- Manual/local asset import into named volumes works and clears asset-degraded readiness. A packaged asset bootstrap/download script is still not implemented.
- The release control-package helper is validated locally with `towerscout:local`; production package validation still needs a published GHCR image pinned by digest.
- GHCR publish workflow is now defined for `ghcr.io/j-schulein/towerscout`, but real digest validation is blocked until an image is published or package-scoped credentials are available.
- Podman's Windows WSL engine path works for the TowerScout runtime contract on this host, but `podman compose` delegated to Docker Desktop's bundled `docker-compose.exe`. Podman should be retested with the Docker Desktop engine stopped, and a Docker-Desktop-free Podman support promise still requires independent Compose-provider validation.
- A first Docker-engine-stopped attempt did not prove independence from Docker Desktop because the Docker daemon remained reachable after WSL termination and Docker Desktop entered a paused state; the Docker validation service is restored.
- Azure provider configuration saved through the containerized UI persists across restart.
- Google validation behind this TLS-inspecting network works after importing the CDC/Zscaler CA chain into the container config volume and pointing `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` / `SSL_CERT_FILE` at the combined bundle; owner-confirmed real Google key entry now succeeds in the UI.
- Local `.env` now preserves the CA bundle path for Docker Compose recreates without storing provider secrets.
- Provider validation failures previously risked exposing keys in exception tracebacks; log and structured-error redaction have been tightened.
- Containerized smoke initially surfaced a non-blocking Ultralytics config warning; this is remediated by `YOLO_CONFIG_DIR=/app/webapp/cache/ultralytics` plus startup directory creation.
- The build surfaced existing frontend dependency audit findings: one moderate and one high npm vulnerability. This is not a container-contract blocker, but it should be tracked as dependency/security follow-up.

**Remaining Validation / Completion Work**:
- Publish or otherwise provide a pinned GHCR image reference by digest and validate the release-image path without `compose.build.yaml`.
- Packaged local/release-folder asset import is implemented and validated. Network download/bootstrap remains optional future work if release assets are hosted externally.
- For release packages, document that operators must copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the combined CA bundle path after running `import-tls-ca.cmd` when their network performs TLS inspection.
- Retry Podman with Docker Desktop fully quit/unavailable, then validate a Docker-Desktop-free Podman Compose provider before promising Podman as the supported open-source runtime.
- Validate the GHCR digest-pinning process against a real published image; local package checksum generation is implemented.
