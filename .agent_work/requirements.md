# TowerScout Local Deployment Requirements

## Executive Summary

This document specifies requirements for transforming TowerScout from a student prototype into a **locally-deployable, user-friendly tool** for cooling tower detection. Requirements are organized using EARS notation and prioritized by Type (A=Quick Fixes, B=Feature Development, C=Architecture Changes).

**DEPLOYMENT MODEL**: **LOCAL DEPLOYMENT** - TowerScout will be deployed on individual user devices (epidemiologists, researchers, health departments) rather than as a hosted service.

**Current State**: Student prototype requiring technical setup  
**Target State**: User-friendly, locally-deployable tool with Docker containerization and cross-platform support

**Key Implications**:
- **Authentication eliminated**: Physical access control sufficient for local deployment
- **Enterprise features simplified**: Focus on ease of installation over complex multi-tenant features
- **Hardware compatibility critical**: Must work across diverse local hardware (AMD64, ARM64, CPU-only systems)
- **User experience paramount**: No IT support means excellent error messages and setup guidance essential
