# Task Backlog - October 2026 Roadmap

**Last Updated**: July 23, 2026
**Planning State**: Fix first while the immutable `v0.1.2` pilot remains in
use. Required release and handoff work takes priority over Task-058/059 stretch
work.
**Hard End**: October 31, 2026; operational closeout October 30

## Required Roadmap Work

| Order | Task | Status | Estimate | Dependencies | Required outcome |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `TASK-098` Dependency Security Remediation And Release Gate | APPROVED_WITH_NON_REGRESSION_CAVEAT / READY_TO_BEGIN | Mandatory slices 4-8 days; full coordinated hardening 6-11 days, plus GPU/runtime host availability | Task-090 classification and project-lead approval complete; pre-change baseline required | Patchable mandatory findings pass regression/package validation with no unapproved feature, workflow, output, or performance regression; no unresolved release-blocking critical/high alert |
| 2 | `TASK-096` User-Initiated Exit And Container Stop | NOT_STARTED | 2-4 days | Task-087 helper/security pattern; current stop scripts | Confirmed Exit/Stop works on Docker and Podman without deleting named volumes |
| 3 | `TASK-097` Podman CPU/GPU Final Path Qualification | NOT_STARTED | 3-5 days plus environment validation | Tasks 090, 098, 087, and 096 | Podman CPU and GPU/CDI pass final-package qualification without Docker Desktop |
| 4 | `TASK-091` Owner-Runnable Release Qualification | NOT_STARTED | 3-6 days | Candidate scope stable; fixture/harness custody | cdcai owner can execute or supervise the minimum release gate |
| 5 | `TASK-092` Documentation Currentness And Information Architecture | NOT_STARTED | Stage A 1-2 days; Stage B as approved | Candidate behavior and package shape | Repo docs, user docs, release notes, external Setup Guide, and demo video agree |
| 6 | `TASK-093` Persistent Data Lifecycle And Recovery Rehearsal | NOT_STARTED | 1-2 days minimum | Runtime profiles and package lifecycle stable | Safe owner-run upgrade, rollback, cleanup, and recovery procedure |
| 7 | `TASK-094` Evidence-Gated Support Snapshot | EVIDENCE_GATED | 1-3 days if selected | Pilot/support evidence | Implement only if real feedback shows a support-diagnostics gap |

### Task-098 Boundary

- Task-090 identified five release-blocking alerts, one required-hardening
  alert, and an all-interface Compose port publication that contradicts the
  local-only runtime boundary.
- Do not patch dependency pins ad hoc before Task-090 establishes reachability,
  compatible target versions, and required regression scope.
- Treat Pillow, Waitress, and the client-relevant aiohttp findings as the first
  patch-oriented slice.
- Treat PyTorch/torchvision/CUDA and Fiona/GeoPandas as coordinated
  compatibility decisions, not isolated pin edits.
- Require written owner acceptance for any residual critical/high risk.
- Ratchet CI for new critical/high findings only after the existing baseline is
  classified and the approved remediation lands.
- Proposed scope:
  [`TASK-090/remediation-scope.md`](./tasks/active/TASK-090/remediation-scope.md).

### Task-096 Boundary

- Use a secured host helper or equally constrained host mechanism.
- Support Docker and Podman.
- Require confirmation.
- Preserve named volumes.
- Do not expose runtime sockets or arbitrary commands to the browser.

### Task-097 Boundary

- Qualify Podman CPU and Podman GPU as supported final paths.
- Cover the approved Compose-provider installer and manual fallback.
- Cover setup, start, readiness, providers, detection, assets, persistence,
  status, logs, TLS repair, Exit/Stop, and cleanup.
- Investigate Podman-machine image-pull and source-build TLS separately from
  Task-087.
- Fix packaged-runtime blockers. Document a source-build-only limitation only
  through an explicit owner decision.

## Conditional Architecture Work

| Order | Task | Status | Estimate | Start gate |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | `TASK-058` Background Detection Jobs And Durable Run State | CONDITIONAL | 3-5 days | Tasks 090, 098, 087, 096, and 097 pass; no pilot blocker; September 18 remains credible |
| 9 | `TASK-059` Backend Layer Decomposition And Logging Consolidation | CONDITIONAL | 3-5 days | Task-058 accepted and remaining schedule margin is still safe |

August 28 is the latest responsible Task-058 capacity checkpoint, not an
earliest start date. Task-058 may begin earlier when all gates pass.

## Existing Follow-On Backlog

| Priority | Task | Status | Recommended disposition |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `TASK-076` Provider API Key Exposure And Restriction Policy | NOT_STARTED | Reassess before final documentation/freeze; include provider-side restriction and ownership guidance |
| 2 | `TASK-068` Windows Test Portability And Script Validation | NOT_STARTED | Pull forward if Tasks 087, 096, or 097 expose repeatable script gaps |
| 3 | `TASK-077` Public Release Manifest And Asset Import Hardening | PARTIAL_FOLLOW_UP | Select only for a demonstrated manifest/import release gap |
| 4 | `TASK-070` Restricted-Network Package Enhancements | NOT_STARTED | Select only if final-package requirements expand beyond managed connected networks |
| 5 | `TASK-027` Enhanced Error Handling | NOT_STARTED | Use for confirmed user-facing error gaps that do not belong to required tasks |
| 6 | `TASK-026` CPU Optimization | NOT_STARTED | Defer unless measured final-candidate CPU performance becomes blocking |
| 7 | `TASK-029` Multi-Provider Fallback | NOT_STARTED | Defer until provider policy and error classification are stable |
| 8 | `TASK-060` Frontend Build Modernization | NOT_STARTED | Maintenance after final release unless current build becomes blocking |
| 9 | `TASK-078` Permissive Apache-Only Runtime Migration | NOT_STARTED | Future release track; not part of October closeout |

Parking lot:

- `TASK-028` Mobile Responsiveness
- `TASK-061` Coordinated NumPy 2 Runtime Migration
- Advanced filtering
- Performance dashboard
- Additional user preferences
