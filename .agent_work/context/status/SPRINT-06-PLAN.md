# Sprint 06 Plan

**Created**: May 11, 2026  
**Sprint Planning Baseline**: Sprint 06 release-readiness planning after Sprint 05 closeout  
**Primary Source Backlog**: `.agent_work/task-backlog.md`  
**Active Carry-Forward**: `TASK-065` remains in `.agent_work/current-tasks.md` pending release-owner support-language review and commit/PR checkpoint  
**Recommended Sprint Theme**: V1 RC1 / pilot-ready AGPL-compliant YOLO-enabled release readiness, not final V1 completion or feature expansion

---

## Executive Summary

Sprint 06 should turn the Sprint 05 runtime and release baseline into a V1 release candidate package that a non-technical Windows pilot user can realistically receive, understand, launch, configure, and test. Under the updated decision direction, this is a YOLO-enabled `agpl-yolo` release path, not an Apache-only release path.

The sprint should not start with broad end-user testing. It should first settle the asset bundle contract and write package-based end-user documentation. Without those two pieces, testers will mostly discover already-known gaps around what to download, where model/data files go, and how to recognize a successful first run.

The recommended Sprint 06 path is:

1. Close `TASK-065`.
2. Promote `TASK-069` to active AGPL release-compliance work.
3. Keep the completed `TASK-072` asset contract, revised for YOLO-derived/AGPL-governed weights.
4. Write end-user release package documentation through `TASK-071`.
5. Run a clean-machine release-candidate validation gate through `TASK-066`.
6. Prepare pilot / UAT execution through `TASK-073`.
7. Carry `TASK-076` in the policy lane with the recorded site/user-owned restricted-key decision.
8. Use remaining capacity for preflight, narrow CI release gates, and Windows script validation.

Sprint 06 should be considered successful when TowerScout reaches **V1 RC1 / pilot-ready** status. Final V1 completion should wait until pilot/UAT feedback has been triaged, install/launch/setup/detection blockers have been fixed or explicitly accepted, and remaining work has been sorted into V1 patch items or the V2 roadmap.

---

## Client Outcome

The client's minimum expectation remains the release target:

> Create a way for users to easily deploy the code from GitHub to their laptops, with all appropriate folder structure intact, clear instructions for any other files that are needed, and a simplified way to set up and run the program locally.

For Sprint 06, this means the team should be able to hand a pilot user:

- a GitHub Release control ZIP or release-candidate equivalent
- a clearly versioned asset bundle or precise asset acquisition instructions
- package-based quick-start instructions
- setup/troubleshooting instructions that assume no project tribal knowledge
- a bounded acceptance test flow
- an issue-reporting path

---

## Task-069 Sign-Off Boundary

Task-069 sign-off is sufficient to merge PR #11 as the Sprint 06 controlled-distribution, AGPL-governed YOLO-enabled RC planning and compliance baseline. This approval is scoped to the near-term RC path and is not final public open-source release approval.

The RC package is not Apache-2.0-only because the current TowerScout detection path includes or depends on Ultralytics/YOLOv5 components and YOLO-derived detector weights.

The release control package must carry AGPL-aware license text, third-party notices, model/data terms, provider terms, source-location/source-offer information, release manifest metadata, checksums, image/source identification, SBOM-reference information, and revocation notes. The container image must carry generic compliance notices and OCI labels sufficient to match it to the release control package by pinned digest.

ONNX or other non-Ultralytics runtime migration is not a pre-RC blocker under this sign-off. Formal owner/legal/reviewer approval remains a later gate for broader distribution, model/data/provider publication, the clean curated public release line, and the final decision on whether the public release remains AGPL-governed with the YOLO path included or moves to a permissive Apache-compatible posture through runtime replacement or separately approved licensing.

The longer-term public release plan should use a clean curated public release line rather than publishing the current working repository history as-is. The current repository should remain the development/workshop repo, while the public line should include only approved source code, public-safe documentation, tests, release scripts, license/notice files, and intentionally selected decision records. Internal planning material, broad `.agent_work/` history, model weights, raw data assets, scratch artifacts, and ambiguous third-party or historical content should be excluded unless explicitly reviewed and approved.

The full Task-069 sign-off plan is recorded in `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-069/TASK-069-SIGN-OFF-PLAN-2026-05-14.md`.

## Sprint Goal

**Sprint 06 Goal**: Produce and internally validate a V1 RC1 / pilot-ready local release package path for Windows 11 AMD64 users, including AGPL-compliant YOLO notices, asset delivery, end-user documentation, release policy boundaries, and a clean-machine validation gate.

### Success Criteria

- The release package and asset bundle relationship is documented and testable.
- End-user docs explain exactly what to download, where to place assets, how to launch, how to configure provider keys, and how to verify success.
- A clean-machine validation run proves the package/docs/assets path before external user testing begins.
- Release policy, model/data terms, source-offer obligations, and provider-key exposure risks are explicitly accepted, mitigated, or converted into blockers.
- External pilot testing begins only after the internal release-candidate gate has produced actionable evidence.
- Final V1 completion is explicitly reserved for after pilot/UAT blocker triage.

---

## Milestone Boundary

### Sprint 06 Target: V1 RC1 / Pilot-Ready

Sprint 06 should end with a release candidate that is ready to put in front of controlled pilot users. That means the release package, asset contract, end-user docs, clean-machine validation, policy decisions, and UAT plan are complete enough to test outside the development context.

### Post-Sprint 06 Target: V1 Complete

V1 should be called complete only after pilot/UAT feedback confirms the package path works for intended users or after remaining pilot findings are explicitly dispositioned. The V1 completion gate should require:

- pilot users can install, launch, and configure TowerScout on a supported Windows laptop
- at least one bounded detection workflow succeeds from the packaged path
- install, launch, setup, detection, and documentation blockers are fixed or owner-accepted
- remaining non-blocking issues are assigned to V1 patch work or moved to the V2 roadmap

### V2 Start Gate

V2 work should not begin until V1 release blockers from pilot/UAT are fixed or intentionally accepted. Architecture, performance, broader platform support, and richer workflow features should remain V2 candidates unless they become necessary to satisfy the V1 pilot-release bar.

---

## Non-Goals

Sprint 06 should not attempt to deliver:

- mobile responsiveness
- advanced filtering
- performance dashboard
- user preferences
- broad NumPy 2 migration
- GPU/CUDA implementation unless explicitly chosen after `TASK-075`
- background-job architecture unless the release path intentionally pauses
- backend decomposition unless `TASK-058` has already clarified durable job/state ownership
- full restricted-network / offline package support unless it becomes a hard launch requirement
- ONNX or other non-Ultralytics runtime migration as a pre-RC blocker; that moves to the later permissive Apache-only release/runtime modernization track

---

## Proposed Sprint Scope

### Committed Lane

| Order | Task | Purpose | Expected Deliverable |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | `TASK-065` Release Packaging And Runtime Support Follow-Through | Close the active carry-forward release-support item. | Owner-reviewed support language and commit/PR checkpoint. |
| 1 | `TASK-069` License And Release Policy Review | Implement the AGPL-compliant YOLO-enabled release posture. | Decision memo, corrected notices, model/data/provider terms, source offer, release control ZIP compliance payload, image generic notices/OCI labels, release manifest, SBOM reference, and revocation notes. |
| 2 | `TASK-072` Release Asset Bundle Contract | Define how out-of-repo model/data assets are distributed and imported under the `agpl-yolo` track. | Asset bundle layout, naming/version rules, checksum policy, release matching rules, import instructions, and YOLO-derived/AGPL-governed model labeling. |
| 3 | `TASK-071` End-User Release Package Documentation | Write docs for the actual AGPL-compliant package path. | User quick start, full package guide, source/license location, troubleshooting, first-run screenshots/checklist, issue-reporting handoff. |
| 4 | `TASK-066` Release Candidate Validation Gate | Internally prove the package/docs/assets/source-notice path before external testing. | Clean-machine validation checklist, results, defects, and release-candidate pass/fail recommendation. |
| 5 | `TASK-073` Clean-Machine Pilot / UAT Execution Plan | Prepare external tester workflow after internal validation. | Tester instructions, acceptance checklist, issue capture template, environment capture checklist, support escalation flow. |

### Policy Lane

These tasks should run early enough that they do not block release late. They can proceed in parallel with documentation and validation when the owner/legal inputs are available.

| Task | Purpose | Expected Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| `TASK-076` Provider API Key Exposure And Restriction Policy | Record and apply the V1 RC1 policy: browser-visible map SDK keys are acceptable only for the local pilot with site/user-owned restricted keys. AGPL does not change provider/API terms. | Provider-key policy, required key restrictions, Task-071 user guidance, and Task-066 validation of key ownership/restriction assumptions. |
| `TASK-075` GPU / CUDA Support Decision | Decide whether v1 is CPU-only or includes a documented CUDA path. | Written decision and documentation update. Implementation only if explicitly selected later. |

### Follow-Through Lane

Select these only if committed-lane work is complete or if `TASK-066` exposes a need that should be fixed before external UAT.

| Task | Trigger | Expected Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| `TASK-074` Runtime Prerequisite Preflight | Tester setup still depends too much on manual runtime diagnosis. | Preflight command or launcher-integrated checks for engine, Compose provider, Podman machine, WSL/virtualization hints, ports, disk, assets, TLS bundle, and provider setup state. |
| `TASK-067` CI Release Gate Tightening | Manual release checks become repetitive or high-risk. | Narrow CI/manual gate coverage for package assembly, image digest, manifest/checksum consistency, and launcher smoke behavior. |
| `TASK-068` Windows Test Portability And Script Validation | Script validation remains environment-sensitive. | Windows-first script validation proof and documented handling for PowerShell Core / CI gaps. |
| `TASK-077` Public Release Manifest And Asset Import Hardening | Compliance payload needs to be package-visible, or `TASK-066` shows import activation risk. | Narrow Sprint 06 slice: release manifest, source URL/ref, checksums, image digest, SBOM reference, model/data terms, and revocation notes. Staged allowlist-only asset activation remains follow-up unless release-critical. |

---

## Recommended Sequence

### Phase 0: Close Carry-Forward

**Task**: `TASK-065`  
**Objective**: Close implementation-complete release-support work before taking on new Sprint 06 scope.

Acceptance expectations:

- Release owner reviews support language and residual caveats.
- Commit/PR checkpoint records the final `TASK-065` release-support updates.
- Any unresolved caveat is moved to `TASK-066`, `TASK-067`, `TASK-068`, `TASK-069`, or `TASK-070`.

### Phase 1: Define The AGPL Release Payload

**Tasks**: `TASK-069`, completed `TASK-072`, and narrow `TASK-077` compliance-payload slice
**Objective**: Make the YOLO-enabled release honest, source-complete, notice-complete, and testable before docs and clean-machine validation.

Acceptance expectations:

- The release track is recorded as `agpl-yolo`.
- Incorrect `YOLO | MIT` attribution is replaced with `Ultralytics YOLOv5 | AGPL-3.0`.
- The release control ZIP includes `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `MODEL_LICENSES.md`, `DATA_LICENSES.md`, `PROVIDER_TERMS.md`, `SOURCE.txt`, `SBOM.txt`, `release-manifest.v1.json`, `IMAGE.txt`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`; the image carries generic notices and OCI labels.
- The package and running browser app expose the source/license location.
- Matching corresponding source requirements are documented for the exact release package/image.
- Asset bundle layout is defined, including:
  - `assets/model_params/yolov5/newest.pt`
  - `assets/model_params/EN/b5_unweighted_best.pt`
  - `assets/data/tl_2025_us_zcta520/`
- Bundle naming and versioning convention is defined.
- Required and optional files are mapped to `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`.
- Checksum verification policy is defined for release-candidate validation and normal user import.
- The relationship between GitHub Release ZIP, GHCR image digest, and asset bundle is explicit.
- The source of each asset is documented, including YOLO-derived/AGPL-governed model labeling and any separate distribution constraints.
- Restricted-network handling is either deferred to `TASK-070` or explicitly included if required.

### Phase 2: Write User-Facing Package Docs

**Task**: `TASK-071`  
**Objective**: Replace source-checkout tester guidance with package-based release guidance for the `agpl-yolo` release track.

Acceptance expectations:

- A one-page quick start exists for Windows 11 AMD64 pilot users.
- A fuller package guide exists for first-line support and testers.
- Docs cover:
  - prerequisite runtime choices
  - package download
  - asset bundle placement
  - `start.bat`
  - Setup Wizard provider-key entry
  - status/log commands
  - asset import
  - source/license notice location
  - model/data/provider terms
  - TLS CA import
  - reset/restart/stop
  - common failures
  - what to report back
- Existing older source/Conda user-testing guides are either marked as legacy/source-install guidance or linked carefully so they do not confuse pilot release users.

### Phase 3: Internal Release Candidate Gate

**Task**: `TASK-066`  
**Objective**: Validate the package/docs/assets path internally before external testing.

Acceptance expectations:

- Run from a clean or representative user-facing Windows environment.
- Use only the release package, asset bundle, docs, and normal user/setup inputs.
- Validate:
  - package extraction
  - `.env` creation from `.env.example`
  - pinned image digest behavior
  - engine/Compose startup
  - readiness states
  - asset import
  - optional hash verification
  - provider-key setup
  - TLS CA import path where relevant
  - restart persistence
  - bounded Google or Azure detection smoke
  - status/log support commands
- Record time-to-first-run, manual interventions, confusing steps, and defects.
- Produce a pass/fail release-candidate recommendation.

### Phase 4: Pilot / UAT Preparation

**Task**: `TASK-073`  
**Objective**: Prepare external testing only after the package path has been internally validated.

Acceptance expectations:

- Tester instructions match the validated release-candidate package.
- Acceptance checklist is bounded and realistic.
- Tester issue-report checklist is ready.
- Environment capture includes OS, CPU/GPU, RAM, engine, Compose provider, network/TLS context, provider used, and whether assets were imported successfully.
- Support escalation path is explicit.
- Pilot start criteria and stop criteria are documented.

### Phase 5: Remaining Security Decisions

**Tasks**: `TASK-076`, `TASK-075`
**Objective**: Avoid late release blockers and implicit support promises.

Acceptance expectations:

- Provider key exposure posture is documented as site/user-owned restricted keys for V1 RC1, with unrestricted shared project keys treated as unsupported or release-blocking.
- GPU/CUDA support is explicitly in scope or out of scope for v1.

---

## Validation Strategy

Sprint 06 validation should focus on user-relevant release confidence.

### Required Validation

- `.agent_work/scripts/validate_agent_work.py`
- release package assembly with immutable image digest
- package inspection for `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, `MODEL_LICENSES.md`, `DATA_LICENSES.md`, `PROVIDER_TERMS.md`, `SOURCE.txt`, `SBOM.txt`, `release-manifest.v1.json`, `IMAGE.txt`, and `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- dependency/path scan proving YOLO is not labeled MIT and vendored YOLO is listed as AGPL-3.0
- source match check confirming the source ref corresponds to the release ZIP and pinned image digest
- asset import from the documented bundle layout
- readiness after missing assets, after asset import, and after provider setup
- launcher startup from `start.bat`
- restart persistence for saved provider config and generated `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
- one bounded detection smoke from the package path
- status/log command output suitable for support

### Conditional Validation

- TLS CA import if the validation environment has TLS inspection or proxy requirements
- Podman-specific validation if Podman remains the preferred runtime target for the pilot group
- Docker validation if Docker is permitted for the pilot group
- CUDA validation only if `TASK-075` decides CUDA is in v1 scope

### Not Required For Sprint 06

- mobile browser testing
- large-area performance optimization
- full offline / air-gapped validation
- multi-user hosting validation
- Mac or ARM64 validation

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Asset distribution remains ambiguous | Testers cannot complete setup without support intervention. | Keep `TASK-072` aligned with the `TASK-069` AGPL release posture and model terms. |
| Docs are written before the package shape is stable | Docs become stale immediately and confuse testers. | Complete asset/package contract before finalizing `TASK-071`. |
| End-user testing starts too early | Feedback is dominated by known package/docs gaps. | Use `TASK-066` as the internal release-candidate gate before `TASK-073` external pilot. |
| Provider SDK keys remain client-visible without matching user guidance | Release may expose unsupported security expectations. | Apply the `TASK-076` decision in `TASK-071` docs and confirm site/user-owned restricted-key assumptions during `TASK-066`; shared unrestricted project keys remain unsupported. |
| AGPL release posture is rejected by reviewers | YOLO-enabled RC cannot be public/compliant under this path. | Revert to restricted pilot now and move ONNX/non-Ultralytics runtime replacement back into the public-release blocker lane. |
| Compliance payload is incomplete | The package may be source-incomplete or notice-incomplete. | Pull forward the narrow `TASK-077` manifest/source/SBOM/checksum/revocation slice. |
| Runtime prerequisites remain too complex | Non-technical users fail before reaching TowerScout setup. | Add `TASK-074` if `TASK-066` shows prerequisite friction. |
| Sprint expands into architecture and features | Release readiness slips again. | Keep `TASK-058`, `TASK-059`, mobile, filtering, dashboard, and preferences outside Sprint 06 unless the release lane intentionally pauses. |
| GPU expectations remain implicit | Users with CUDA machines may expect acceleration that v1 does not support. | Complete `TASK-075` decision and update docs accordingly. |

---

## Definition Of Done

Sprint 06 can be considered successful if TowerScout reaches V1 RC1 / pilot-ready status and:

- `TASK-065` is closed or intentionally carried with documented owner acceptance.
- `TASK-069`, `TASK-072`, and `TASK-071` are complete enough to give to a pilot user.
- `TASK-066` has produced clean-machine evidence and a release-candidate recommendation.
- `TASK-073` has a ready tester workflow if the release candidate passes.
- `TASK-076` policy is recorded and either validated through `TASK-066` or clearly blocking with owners and next actions.
- The backlog no longer treats parked tail work as active v1 release scope.

Sprint 06 completion does not by itself mean final V1 completion. Final V1 requires pilot/UAT blocker triage after controlled external testing.

---

## Sprint Deliverables

- Release asset bundle contract.
- AGPL-compliant YOLO release decision memo and corrected notices.
- Release manifest, source notice, SBOM reference, checksums, image digest metadata, model/data/provider terms, and revocation notes.
- Package-based end-user quick start.
- Package-based full user guide / support guide.
- Clean-machine release-candidate validation report.
- Pilot / UAT execution checklist.
- License and release policy memo.
- Provider API key exposure/restriction policy memo.
- GPU/CUDA v1 scope decision.
- Optional runtime preflight and release CI/script gate improvements if capacity allows.

## Open Questions

1. What exact release vehicle will pilot users receive first: a GitHub Release draft, a manually shared release-candidate ZIP, or a repo-local validation package?
2. Who owns the asset bundle source of truth and permission to redistribute model weights and ZCTA data with the release materials?
3. Are pilot users expected to use Podman, Docker, or either runtime depending on local policy?
4. Does the pilot cohort include enterprise TLS inspection environments?
5. Provider keys are assumed site/user-owned for V1 RC1 pilot testing; project-provided shared keys are unsupported unless separately risk-accepted or stronger controls are implemented.
6. Is CUDA acceleration expected by any pilot tester, or should v1 be explicitly CPU-only?
7. What is the minimum detection smoke that proves the package path without creating a long or fragile user test?
8. Will reviewers accept AGPL as the public/pilot release posture, or should the team revert to restricted pilot plus ONNX/non-Ultralytics migration before public release?

---

## Planning Decision

The recommended Sprint 06 planning decision is:

**Run Sprint 06 as a V1 RC1 AGPL-compliant YOLO-enabled release-readiness sprint.** Do not start broad end-user testing until the AGPL compliance payload, asset contract, and package docs are complete and `TASK-066` has validated the clean-machine release-candidate path. Public Apache-only release becomes a later separate runtime migration track.
