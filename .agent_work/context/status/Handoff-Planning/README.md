   - current rules for the unchanged `v0.1.2` pilot and cdcai feedback hold

## Current Decision

- Keep the six `v0.1.2` pilot assets immutable.
- Develop owner-requested fixes in the fork under `v0.1.3-rc.N`.
- Do not publish `v0.1.3` final prematurely.
- Keep `cdcai/TowerScout` unchanged until the owner-qualified final candidate
  receives explicit adoption approval.
- Qualify Docker CPU, Docker GPU, Podman CPU, and Podman GPU.
- Task-090 alert classification and Task-098 mandatory remediation are
  complete as of their July 27 closeout.
- Task-099 completed alerts `#72-#75` plus npm finding
  `GHSA-5p4m-2wfm-xmqj` through PRs #68/#69. Alert `#74` closed without
  dismissal, and only the eight documented torch residuals remain.
- Task-087 continues under its own package, signing, provider/recovery,
  Podman, and representative managed-endpoint gates.
- Complete operational closeout by October 30, 2026.

## Active Validation Record

The frozen Pilot Package remains active while feedback is collected. Its
sanitized validation record remains under:

- [`v0.1.2-Validation-Evidence/`](./v0.1.2-Validation-Evidence/)

This evidence proves the Pilot Package; it does not certify a future candidate.

The separate current Task-087 functional record is:

- [`../../../tasks/active/TASK-087/FULL-PACKAGE-VALIDATION-EVIDENCE-2026-08-05.md`](../../../tasks/active/TASK-087/FULL-PACKAGE-VALIDATION-EVIDENCE-2026-08-05.md)

That record covers an authorized unsigned development-workstation validation
only. It does not approve release, merge, TLS mutation, or cdcai adoption. A
signed production-shaped build on a representative managed endpoint remains
the next external gate. Normal-size controls clipping at this host's display
scaling, resolved during validation by maximizing the launcher, remains a
non-blocking UI follow-up before that build.

## Archived Planning And Release History

Superseded strategies, July 22 roadmap iterations, external reviews, and
v0.1.0-v0.1.2 publication checklists moved to:

- [`context/archive/2026-07/Handoff-Planning/`](../../archive/2026-07/Handoff-Planning/)

They are historical evidence only. Their dates, commands, and adoption
recommendations do not authorize current execution.
