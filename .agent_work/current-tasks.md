# Current Tasks - Active Sprint

**Sprint Period**: Sprint 06 planning / V1 RC1 readiness begins May 11, 2026  
**Last Updated**: June 26, 2026
**Focus**: Produce a V1 RC1 / pilot-ready AGPL-compliant YOLO-enabled release path by closing release-support carry-forward work, correcting release compliance artifacts, writing package-based end-user docs, validating the clean-machine release candidate, and preparing pilot / UAT execution.
**Status**: Sprint 06 committed lane selected. `TASK-065`, `TASK-072`, `TASK-079`, `TASK-071`, `TASK-067`, and `TASK-074` are completed and remain in the active task folder until sprint closeout; `TASK-069` sign-off is sufficient to merge PR #11 as the internal controlled AGPL-governed RC planning and compliance baseline; `TASK-075` implementation is merged and its GPU support claims are now bounded by `TASK-083` evidence; `TASK-066` post-PR28 final prerelease Docker Desktop package path passed through checksum verification, bootstrap/readiness from the GitHub Release Application Package, Settings-linked docs, `/license`, in-container asset hash verification, and bounded Azure detection smoke on the refreshed final digest; `TASK-073` is active for clean-machine pilot/UAT planning and now has an RC6 handoff packet with exact artifact values, default smoke fixture, support contacts, and provider-key evidence boundaries; official RC6 release publication and downloaded-release validation are complete, while tester cohort selection and owner/reviewer acceptance remain before external tester launch; `TASK-080` has simplified the first-cohort setup path, produced and locked the consolidated Word guide, verified the Google first-launch TLS support path, and published/validated the refreshed rc3 UAT release package; `TASK-081` runtime hardening landed on `main`; `TASK-082` landed on `main` as `v0.1.0-rc4` with stable docs naming and package wiring; `TASK-083` landed through merged PR #33 after validating RC5 candidate 3 across Docker CPU, Docker GPU, Docker-Desktop-free Podman CPU, Podman GPU CDI, and fixed-fixture parity; `TASK-084` merged its GA packaging implementation slice through PR #34 and Podman package asset-import stabilization through PR #38, then completed official `v0.1.0-rc6` publication and downloaded-release verification on June 17, 2026; `TASK-085` merged its dataset ZIP restore traversal hardening through PR #35; RC6 CPU/CUDA images and control ZIPs were rebuilt from `main` at `12daa5536f580f76d063559e86b9a474451bc54b`; static checks, Docker CPU, Docker CUDA CPU-fallback, Podman CPU with approved package-local provider, CPU-package `-Gpu on` guardrail validation, Docker GPU validation, Podman GPU CDI validation, public-safe evidence summary preparation, official release handoff, publication, and downloaded CPU package validation have passed.

## Sprint 05 Closeout Summary

Sprint 05 delivered the runtime and release-readiness foundation that Sprint 04 intentionally left open. The completed Sprint 05 task artifacts have been moved from `.agent_work/tasks/active/` to `.agent_work/tasks/completed/`:

- `TASK-051`: runtime dependency verification and split
- `TASK-055`: YOLO Torch Hub pinned-ref hardening
- `TASK-056`: first-run reliability and runtime determinism hardening
- `TASK-057`: local YOLO runtime ownership and Torch Hub independence
- `TASK-052`: current integration smoke-test baseline
- `TASK-062`: pre-Docker runtime cleanup and YOLO loader hardening
- `TASK-063`: pre-Docker release hardening and CI reproducibility gate
- `TASK-064`: targeted runtime responsiveness and inference baseline
- `TASK-025`: Docker-compatible / OCI containerization
- `TASK-054`: local launch UX Phase 1 MVP

`TASK-029` was never started during Sprint 05. Its task artifact has been archived as a not-started planning artifact, and the task remains in the backlog table rather than staying in the active sprint.

---

## Sprint 06 Goal

Produce and internally validate a V1 RC1 / pilot-ready local release package path for Windows 11 AMD64 users, including AGPL-compliant YOLO release notices, asset delivery, end-user documentation, release policy boundaries, and a clean-machine validation gate.

Sprint 06 is not intended to declare final V1 completion. Final V1 completion should wait until pilot/UAT feedback has been triaged, install/launch/setup/detection blockers have been fixed or explicitly accepted, and remaining work has been sorted into V1 patch items or the V2 roadmap.

## Active Carry-Forward

### **TASK-065: Release Packaging And Runtime Support Follow-Through**
**Status**: COMPLETED - release-owner support-language review accepted on May 11, 2026  
**Type**: B/C (Release Engineering / Runtime Supportability)  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 intake / post-`TASK-054` release-support gate  
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-065-release-packaging-runtime-support.md`

**Objective**: Close the release-support items intentionally deferred from `TASK-025` and informed by `TASK-054`, without reopening the completed OCI/container runtime baseline or launcher MVP.

**Current State**:
- Docker-Desktop-free Podman Compose-provider validation passed in the earlier
  TASK-065 support path; TASK-083 later superseded the current RC5 provider
  evidence with standalone Docker Compose v5.1.4 selected through
  `PODMAN_COMPOSE_PROVIDER`.
- Hosted asset download/bootstrap is out of scope for the v1 control package.
- Bundled OCI image archive fallback is unsupported for the v1 control package; restricted-network support should use support-managed image preload plus local asset import.
- Broad browser/provider regression passed for Google and Azure after launcher browser targeting was changed to `http://localhost:<port>`.
- Missing TLS CA bundle handling now returns actionable setup/support guidance instead of a generic provider-validation 500.
- Release package assembly validation passed into ignored `dist/towerscout-task065-validation`.
- Reviewer hardening addressed evidence redaction, immutable digest enforcement, provider-aware TLS CA verification, Compose-provider reporting, and focused tests.

**Closeout Status**:
- Release owner accepted the final support language and residual caveats on May 11, 2026.
- Commit checkpoint `2280b68 chore(task-065): complete release support validation` records the release-support updates.
- Follow-up tasks remain in the backlog for clean-machine release-candidate validation, CI gate tightening, Windows/Podman automation, license policy review, and restricted-network package enhancements.

**Validation Notes**:
- `tests/unit/test_config.py tests/unit/test_release_package_script.py` passed after reviewer hardening.
- PowerShell parser checks passed for release helper scripts.
- Podman launcher provider-reporting check passed and reached readiness `ready`.
- `npm.cmd run test:stage-0` remains not runnable in this shell because the Windows `bash.exe` path resolves to WSL without `/bin/bash`.

**User Value**: Turns the completed container and launcher baseline into release-support language and validation evidence that can be trusted by non-technical local users and first-line support.

## Sprint 06 Committed Lane

### **TASK-072: Release Asset Bundle Contract**
**Status**: COMPLETED - V1 RC1 asset bundle contract documented
**Type**: C (Release Engineering / Asset Governance)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1  
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-072-release-asset-bundle-contract.md`

**Objective**: Define how model weights and ZIP-code data are bundled, versioned, checksummed, distributed, placed next to the release package, imported, verified, and matched to a TowerScout release.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-065`; current `webapp/asset_manifest.v1.json`; release package shape.

**Closeout Status**:
- Durable contract created at `docs/release-asset-bundle-contract.md`.
- Release package generation now includes the asset bundle contract doc.
- Asset ZIP root layout is `model_params/`, `data/`, and `asset_manifest.v1.json`; users extract those entries into the package `assets/` directory before import.
- External asset ZIP publication is allowed only for the accepted `agpl-yolo` release posture when the release manifest and model notices label YOLO weights as YOLO-derived/AGPL-governed unless separate written terms say otherwise.

**User Value**: Removes the largest current ambiguity in the local release path: what non-git assets users need, where those assets come from, and exactly where they go.

### **TASK-069: License And Release Policy Review**
**Status**: SIGN_OFF_RECORDED - sufficient to merge PR #11 as internal Sprint 06 RC baseline
**Type**: C (Legal / Release Policy / Governance)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day technical prep plus owner/legal review
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1
**Task Folder**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-069/`

**Objective**: Convert the prior Apache-only public-release strategy into an AGPL-compliant YOLO-enabled RC/pilot release posture for review, with corrected notices, model/data terms, source-offer requirements, release control package compliance payload, and image generic notices/OCI labels.

**Current Direction**:
- The YOLO-enabled release track is `agpl-yolo`.
- The ONNX/non-Ultralytics runtime migration is no longer a pre-RC blocker; it moves to a later permissive Apache-only release or runtime modernization path.
- TowerScout-authored code may be Apache-2.0 where ownership and relicensing authority are confirmed, but the full YOLO-enabled package/image is not Apache-2.0-only.
- The release control package must include corrected YOLO AGPL attribution, model/data/provider terms, release manifest, checksums, image digest metadata, SBOM reference, source notice, and revocation notes; the image carries generic compliance notices and OCI labels sufficient to match it to the control package by pinned digest.
- Model weights may be published only with AGPL-compatible labeling or separate written terms.
- Formal owner/legal/reviewer approval remains a later gate for broader distribution, model/data/provider publication, and the clean curated public release line; the current development/workshop repository history should not be published as-is without explicit review.

**User Value**: Allows Sprint 06 to target a YOLO-enabled RC/pilot without waiting for detector runtime replacement, while keeping the release honest about AGPL obligations and source availability.

### **TASK-079: RC1 Reliability Fixes And Performance Instrumentation**
**Status**: COMPLETED - Phase 3 CPU optimization validated; single GPU-capable package plan handed to TASK-075
**Type**: C (Release-Critical Reliability / Detection Workflow Hardening)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: Phase 1: 1-2 days (8-16 hours); Phase 2A/2B: 0.5-1 day investigation; Phase 3 follow-up depends on benchmark and GPU/CUDA evidence
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-079-rc1-reliability-fixes.md`

**Objective**: Fix or harden the pre-RC reliability issues affecting detected-tower address display, Azure drawing-shape validation, and model-performance diagnosis without disrupting the V1 RC1 package, asset, provider setup, or readiness contracts.

**Current Direction**:
- Phase 1 code and validation are complete: shared geocoding TLS preflight, canonical coordinate fallback, neighboring geocache bucket lookup, Azure completed-shape validation cleanup, address escaping, additive model phase timing, and a 6-tile Azure bounded smoke with right-panel address and drawing-tool confirmation.
- Phase 2A research is complete: the fixed 6-tile benchmark reproduced 41 raw detections and 9 EfficientNet candidates, but measured secondary-classifier time around `13.8s` rather than the live smoke's `69.48s`. EfficientNet batching is output-stable and can save roughly `15-20%` of CPU secondary time on benchmark fixtures, but it does not fully explain the live outlier.
- Phase 2B research is complete: current code can auto-use CUDA only when CUDA-enabled PyTorch and visible NVIDIA devices are present; the RC package path currently installs CPU-only PyTorch wheels and has no Compose GPU reservation.
- Phase 3 CPU optimization is complete: EfficientNet review-band candidates are batched with default batch size `8`, secondary-classifier subphase/candidate diagnostics are recorded, and EfficientNet now falls back to CPU if CUDA setup is visible but unusable.
- RC1 remains CPU-safe by default. The approved follow-up direction is a single CUDA-capable package/image with CPU fallback, optional GPU launch overlay, explicit runtime diagnostics, and validation gates documented in `.agent_work/context/analysis/task-079-single-gpu-capable-package-plan.md`; the PR #14 review disposition adds shared device-policy resolution, EfficientNet per-chunk CUDA transfer, readiness diagnostics, GPU concurrency, and fixed-fixture parity as `TASK-075` entry criteria.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-065`; `TASK-069`; `TASK-072`; current detection/geocoding/provider workflows. `TASK-071` and `TASK-066` should consume this task's outcomes for docs and clean-machine validation.

**User Value**: Reduces the chance that RC1 pilot users encounter missing addresses, rejected valid Azure shapes, or unexplained slow detections, while keeping the release path supportable and measured.

### **TASK-075: Single GPU-Capable Package Implementation**
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - Phase 3 GPU overlay and launcher implemented; NVIDIA host validation pending
**Type**: C (Runtime Policy / Hardware Compatibility / Release Packaging)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 1-3 days (8-24 hours), split by validation availability
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-075-single-gpu-capable-package.md`

**Objective**: Implement the reviewed single GPU-capable TowerScout package direction while preserving a CPU-safe default release path.

**Current Direction**:
- Phase 1 runtime policy is implemented: shared `TOWERSCOUT_DEVICE=auto|cpu|cuda` policy resolution lives in `webapp/ts_device.py`.
- Readiness now includes non-loading `ml_runtime` diagnostics.
- YOLO and EfficientNet report requested policy, selected device, CUDA build, CUDA availability, device name, and fallback reason.
- EfficientNet CUDA batching now stacks and transfers candidate tensors per configured chunk.
- GPU concurrency has an explicit conservative default through `TOWERSCOUT_GPU_CONCURRENCY`.
- CUDA and CPU proof images now build from the current branch. The CUDA image uses `torch==2.2.1+cu121`, preserves CPU fallback on this non-GPU host, and fails closed with readiness guidance when `TOWERSCOUT_DEVICE=cuda` is required without an exposed GPU.
- The local CUDA proof image is `7.11GB`; the current CPU proof image is `2.8GB`, making the size tradeoff about `4.31GB`.
- Optional `compose.gpu.yaml` is implemented and included in release package staging.
- `start.bat` / `scripts/launch.ps1` now support `-Gpu off|auto|on`; default `off` remains CPU-safe, `auto` only requests the overlay when a simple Docker/NVIDIA host preflight detects a GPU, and `on` explicitly requires CUDA.
- TASK-075 originally kept GPU support claims pending hardware evidence. TASK-083
  now provides RC5 support-assigned Docker GPU and Podman GPU runtime evidence.
  TASK-084 carries GA image/package delivery decisions.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-079`; `TASK-051`; `TASK-065`; `TASK-071`; `TASK-066`.

**User Value**: Gives pilot users one package path that can accelerate on supported NVIDIA hosts while still launching predictably on CPU-only machines.

### **TASK-071: End-User Release Package Documentation**
**Status**: COMPLETED - focused validation passed; ready for TASK-066
**Type**: B/C (Documentation / User Enablement)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1  
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-071-end-user-release-docs.md`

**Objective**: Produce the package-based quick start and full user guide that tell a non-technical Windows pilot user what to download, where assets go, how to launch, how to configure provider keys, how to validate success, how to find source/license notices, and how to report problems.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-069`; `TASK-072`; `TASK-075`; release package shape; current OCI quick-start/runtime docs.

**Closeout Status**:
- Package-local Quick Start, Package Guide, User Guide, Project Overview, and styled HTML docs were added under `docs/`.
- Settings Resource Links now point to package-local Project Overview, User Guide, Source/licenses, Video Guides, and TowerScout Research Article.
- `/docs/` serves the package-local Quick Start, `/license` serves a styled HTML source/license page, and `/license.txt` remains available for plain-text notices.
- Release package and runtime image assembly now include package-local docs needed by Resource Links.
- Older source/Conda tester guides are labeled as legacy source-install guidance.
- The Quick Start and support docs now explicitly list prerequisite software: Windows 11 AMD64, PowerShell, browser, outbound internet, disk space, Docker Desktop/WSL 2 as the primary pilot path, qualified Podman boundaries, and provider key; they also state Git/Python/Conda/Node/VS Code are not required for the package path.
- Focused Flask route, license, release package, docs-command, and agent-work validation passed with only the known `127.0.0.1` docs warning.

**User Value**: Converts the engineered release package into a self-service pilot path instead of a support-only handoff.

### **TASK-066: Release Candidate Validation Gate**
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - final prerelease Docker Desktop package path and bounded Azure provider smoke passed; Podman source-build TLS, Docker-Desktop-free Podman, and NVIDIA GPU evidence pending
**Type**: C (Release Engineering / Validation)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours)  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1  
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-066-release-candidate-validation-gate.md`

**Objective**: Internally prove the release package, asset bundle, docs, setup flow, restart persistence, and bounded detection path from a clean user-facing environment before external pilot/UAT begins. Also evaluate PR16 follow-ups for visible CI/static-analysis release gates and Markdown-to-HTML generation or parity checks for Settings-linked docs.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-065`; `TASK-069`; `TASK-071`; `TASK-072`; agreed release package shape.

**Current State**:
- Final Docker Desktop validation generated and published the RC control package with refreshed post-PR28 GHCR digest `sha256:e90524870a279c04f941147fc30328636ac97f75be200fd06c929df83c49d158`, imported all 9 manifest assets with hash verification, reached readiness, served package-local docs and `/license`, and passed the owner-selected bounded Azure detection smoke on the public `200 west st, New York, NY 10282` fixture.
- Validation found and fixed three release-path blockers: non-default port asset import, stale model discovery after asset copy, and hidden EfficientNet first-use download.
- Docker Desktop and Podman package runtime paths are validated for CPU-default launch against the digest-pinned GHCR image. On this host, `podman compose` delegates to Docker Compose v5.1.3 as its external provider.
- `TASK-074` bootstrap/preflight follow-through passed clean post-merge package validation: verify-only asset ZIP checks are non-mutating, asset ZIP staging/import succeeds, packaged Compose entrypoints initialize `.env` from `.env.example`, and readiness reaches `setup_required` with assets `ok`.
- Podman source-build/base-image pulls from Docker Hub still fail TLS certificate verification inside the Podman VM before TowerScout code runs; this does not block the normal GHCR package path but remains a developer/build-path caveat.
- GPU acceleration remains unclaimed until NVIDIA Docker Desktop WSL2 host validation, fixed-fixture parity, and timing evidence pass.
- The non-runtime Flask route-test timeout/isolation gap identified during review was closed by `TASK-067` / PR #19. Focused route/config/runtime tests now run with `pytest-timeout` active and isolated test runtime paths.

**User Value**: Prevents end-user testing from being dominated by known package/docs/asset gaps and produces evidence that the V1 RC1 path is actually usable.

### **TASK-067: CI Release Gate Tightening**
**Status**: COMPLETED - PR #19 merged
**Type**: C (CI / Release Engineering / Test Reliability)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day (4-8 hours)
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-067-ci-release-gate-tightening.md`

**Objective**: Tighten the RC validation baseline where `TASK-066` exposed fragility: pytest route-test collection could hang without diagnostics, Flask route tests could touch local runtime config, and stale legacy `AGENTS.md/` guidance could confuse future agent work.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-066`; current CI workflow; route-test coverage; `.github` guidance baseline.

**Current State**:
- PR #19 merged on May 27, 2026, adding pytest timeout safeguards, CI timeout limits, route-test runtime path isolation, and legacy `AGENTS.md/` removal.
- Focused validation passed for Flask routes, runtime/config path helpers, Task-079 reliability coverage, CI workflow summary, `.agent_work` validation, `git diff --check`, and pytest timeout config recognition.
- This task intentionally keeps broader asset-backed package smoke checks advisory unless a later release-gate ratchet promotes them.

**User Value**: Restores confidence in internal validation before external pilot prep and reduces the chance that future agents follow stale instructions.

### **TASK-073: Clean-Machine Pilot / UAT Execution Plan**
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - RC6 handoff packet refreshed with exact CPU/CUDA package values, public-safe evidence boundary, support contacts, and default smoke fixture; official RC6 publication and downloaded-release validation passed; tester cohort selection, provider setup / bounded Azure smoke in the official tester path, and owner/reviewer acceptance remain pending
**Type**: B/C (User Testing / Release Validation)  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day (4-8 hours)  
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1  
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-073-clean-machine-uat-plan.md`

**Objective**: Define the controlled pilot/UAT workflow, tester instructions, bootstrap-first acceptance checklist, environment capture, issue-report workflow, success criteria, support escalation path, and first-launch guidance for users without prior command-line experience.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-066`; `TASK-067`; `TASK-071`; `TASK-074`; RC1 user package docs.

**User Value**: Ensures external testing starts from a repeatable, evidence-producing workflow instead of ad hoc feedback collection.

### **TASK-080: RC1 UAT User Guide And Setup Process Simplification**
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - rc2 release validation passed earlier; pre-UAT follow-up docs/runtime/status-message changes are implemented with focused coverage; live Google first-launch passed after TLS CA support-path validation; Word visual QA and final pre-package validation passed; refreshed rc3 package/image/GitHub prerelease validation passed; final handoff signoff and tester/cohort selection remain pending before external handoff
**Type**: B/C (User Testing / Documentation / Release UX)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours), plus optional launcher follow-through
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1 external UAT readiness
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-080-uat-user-guide-process-simplification.md`

**Objective**: Revise the first-cohort RC1 UAT process so non-technical testers receive one clear, start-to-finish user guide instead of several overlapping technical documents. Produce a Microsoft Word RC1 UAT User Guide, simplify the working-folder/download/extraction flow, move manual checksum work toward support fallback or automated setup verification, and expose Podman/GPU validation only as support-assigned optional tracks after the Docker Desktop CPU baseline.

**Current Direction**:
- Introduce `setup-towerscout.cmd` as the normal first-cohort setup command.
- Default to Docker Desktop and `-Gpu off`.
- Auto-discover the Model & Data Package ZIP from the extracted package folder
  or parent `TowerScoutUAT` folder when exactly one matching ZIP is present.
- Keep `-Engine podman`, `-Gpu auto`, and `-Gpu on` for support-assigned
  validation tracks.
- Keep `bootstrap.cmd` as the advanced explicit-path support helper.
- Consolidated Word guide added at
  `.agent_work/user-testing/instructions/TowerScout_V1_RC1_UAT_User_Guide.docx`.
  Owner review in Microsoft Word is still needed because local render QA could
  not run without `pdf2image`/LibreOffice/Word automation.
- Word guide remains outside the release package for now; package-facing
  Markdown/HTML and UAT handoff docs now use the same
  `Documents\TowerScoutUAT` working-folder model.
- Current refreshed UAT release version is `v0.1.0-rc3`, with source ref
  `8ce6375e7f2b74df773e27e4f081e4199eb54a68` and image digest
  `sha256:796e0a7a03d3000199b3a40cc074fa5ca140232706a8747ff4d0eac0e4d85d5f`.
  The GitHub prerelease at
  `https://github.com/J-Schulein/TowerScout/releases/tag/v0.1.0-rc3` includes
  the four expected rc3 assets. Application Package checksum:
  `d298607b7d7fd2a3d93c6118994e0e139d32626061e39fb950330ea5388e12f0`.
  Model & Data Package checksum:
  `00599cc4fe9f2bdb4708c669d7c3d9a8a570a0c3b547bc5c317026196c7bacbb`.
  Local Docker validation used isolated project
  `towerscout-task080-rc3-smoke` on port `5016`, and downloaded-release
  validation used isolated project `towerscout-task080-rc3-download` on port
  `5017`; both reached readiness `setup_required` with assets `ok` and were
  stopped afterward.
- Prior corrected UAT release version was `v0.1.0-rc2`, with source ref
  `4e8054d27faa1f956998f85b665a4ea28fc01ed9` and image digest
  `sha256:f3caa7915f7a8d70326b2fa84d62ec86e142c38c7d22615106e192d7f7821946`.
- Local rc2 package generation produced
  `dist\towerscout-v0.1.0-rc2.zip` and
  `dist\towerscout-v0.1.0-rc2-assets-towerscout-v1-assets-2026-05-05.zip`.
  The GitHub prerelease at
  `https://github.com/J-Schulein/TowerScout/releases/tag/v0.1.0-rc2` includes
  the four expected rc2 assets. Local Docker validation used isolated project
  `towerscout-task080-rc2` on port `5011`, and downloaded-release validation
  used isolated project `towerscout-task080-rc2-download` on port `5012`; both
  reached readiness `setup_required` with assets `ok`. Provider setup and the
  bounded Azure smoke used isolated project
  `towerscout-task080-rc2-provider` on port `5013`, reached readiness
  `ready` with Azure configured and assets `ok`, and completed the public
  Azure fixture with `48` detection records, `8` tile records, right-panel
  address/provider metadata, and elapsed time about `56.38` seconds.
- First-cohort Google setup validation feedback exposed a generic
  `/api/config/validate-key` 502 in the Setup Wizard. The validation path now
  reports provider network/TLS failures with support-safe guidance, the wizard
  continues checking another entered provider if one provider fails, and
  provider key previews were removed from route/browser logs.
- Pre-UAT follow-up changes added a Docker/Podman-running setup reminder,
  command appendix, corrected PubMed research link, concise email/Teams issue
  form, provider-aware normal-mode output-panel messages, and a 12-hour UAT
  stale-container guard that restarts stopped/unhealthy/stale containers while
  preserving named volumes by default.
- Live Google first-launch Setup Wizard verification passed after importing the
  CDC/Zscaler TLS inspection CA into the isolated Docker stack. This confirms
  the repeated Google failure was a managed-network container trust issue, not
  a bad Google key or unresolved Setup Wizard defect.
- Owner-edited Word UAT guide was integrated on 2026-06-10 with formatting and
  readability changes. After a low-level heading correction triggered a Word
  unreadable-content warning, the guide was restored byte-for-byte from the
  Word-authored edited file and required command/TLS/support-safe evidence
  content was structurally verified. Owner completed Microsoft Word visual QA
  on 2026-06-11 and approved locking the guide for final validation.
- Final pre-package validation passed on 2026-06-11 across focused unit,
  release-package, frontend contract, bundle consistency, docs, agent-work,
  whitespace, and targeted secret-safety checks.
- Refreshed rc3 package, image, GitHub prerelease, and downloaded-release setup
  validation passed on 2026-06-11.
- Remaining approval gates are final handoff signoff and tester/cohort
  selection.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-066`; `TASK-071`; `TASK-073`; `TASK-074`; `TASK-075`; possible `TASK-076` provider-key policy language.

**User Value**: Reduces first-cohort UAT friction by turning the validated release package path into a plain-language walkthrough that explains what users are doing, why each step matters, what success looks like, and how to report safe evidence if blocked.

### **TASK-081: RC3 Runtime Hardening And Podman Independence**
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - runtime defaults, launcher/import hardening, route safety fixes, docs, focused automated validation, live Podman CPU launch/import validation, and live Docker Desktop CPU launch/import validation passed; TASK-083 now carries the RC5 Docker/Podman GPU evidence and TASK-084 carries GA packaging follow-through
**Type**: C (Runtime Hardening / Podman Support / Release Validation)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 days (16-32 hours), split between CPU-dev-able fixes and hardware-dependent GPU validation
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1 / post-rc3 hardening
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-081-rc3-runtime-hardening-podman-independence.md`

**Objective**: Implement the actionable RC3 runtime hardening, Podman independence, launcher/device-integrity, and reviewer-audit recommendations while preserving the CPU-safe UAT baseline; TASK-083 now carries the superseding RC5 Podman GPU support-assigned evidence.

**Current Direction**:
- Treat the empirical GPU/Podman replay as the controlling analysis: the observed Docker GPU, Docker CPU, and Podman CPU outputs matched on the same 25-tile fixture, so no model or TF32 precision change is currently justified as the T1000 fix.
- Fix pre-UAT runtime correctness issues first: default image references, restart policy, liveness-based engine selection, and Podman asset import fallback.
- Make selected runtime/device state unmistakable in launcher, import, readiness, and support output so stale containers or mode changes cannot silently reuse the wrong CPU/GPU path.
- Productize Podman CPU independence through an explicit Compose-provider decision, provider/version reporting, focused tests, and documentation that distinguishes package runtime from source-build/TLS caveats.
- Include the small reviewer-audit hardening items that are low-risk and release-relevant: upload filename sanitization, debug Azure route removal, and a pilot tile cap.
- TASK-083 supersedes this task's original Podman GPU gate with support-assigned
  RC5 evidence for WSL2/CDI preflight, readiness, and fixed-fixture parity.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-066`; `TASK-073`; `TASK-074`; `TASK-075`; `TASK-080`; owner-provided RC3 GPU/Podman and reviewer-audit documents dated 2026-06-11.

**User Value**: Reduces the chance that external UAT is blocked by runtime ambiguity, stale device mode, Podman provider gaps, or known reviewer-audit quick fixes, while preserving honest support boundaries for GPU and Podman.

### **TASK-082: RC4 Documentation And Package Organization**
**Status**: COMPLETED - landed on `main` as `v0.1.0-rc4` in commit `32074a7`; stable docs naming, package docs, app docs links, and repo-organization triage are validated for the rc4 baseline
**Type**: B/C (Documentation / Release UX / Package Organization)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours), plus optional package-smoke validation
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1 / post-rc3 to rc4 readiness
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-082-rc4-docs-package-organization.md`

**Objective**: Make the user-facing docs, release-package docs, app Resource
Links, and repo documentation organization ready for the next `rc4` package
without stale `v1-rc1`, `rc2`, or mixed-audience guidance confusing pilot users.

**Current Direction**:
- Replace release-candidate-specific primary doc filenames with stable names
  such as `quick-start.md`, `package-guide.md`, `user-guide.md`, and
  `project-overview.md`, while deciding whether old `v1-rc1-*` paths should be
  retained as compatibility stubs.
- Add visible metadata to user/support docs so readers can see which release
  candidate they apply to, when they were reviewed, who the audience is, and
  what runtime support boundary is in force.
- Remove or clearly label stale `rc2`/`rc3` examples before `rc4` package
  generation.
- Keep the normal user path short and current: download the Application
  Package ZIP plus checksum and Model & Data Package ZIP plus checksum, extract
  only the Application Package ZIP, keep the Model & Data Package ZIP beside
  the extracted folder, then run `setup-towerscout.cmd`.
- Align all docs with the then-current support boundary from `TASK-081`: Docker
  CPU primary, Podman CPU support-assigned and qualified, and Docker GPU
  support-assigned after validation. TASK-083 supersedes this for RC5 with
  support-assigned Podman GPU after CDI validation.
- Update `README.md`, Settings Resource Links, `/docs/`, Flask public-doc
  allowlists, package-release file inclusion, and tests together when docs are
  renamed.
- Classify `docs/` and repo-root material by audience/purpose before moving or
  removing anything; keep broad moves for `Model/`, `SyntheticData/`,
  `TowerScoutSite/`, and `hosting/` deferred unless explicitly approved.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-071`; `TASK-073`; `TASK-074`; `TASK-075`; `TASK-080`;
`TASK-081`; possible `TASK-076` provider-key policy review.

**User Value**: Prevents the next release package from asking non-technical
users to reason through stale RC labels, historical examples, duplicate docs,
or implementation-contract material before they can install and run TowerScout.

### **TASK-083: RC5 Podman Independence, GPU CDI, And Release Validation**
**Status**: COMPLETED - PR #33 merged on June 16, 2026 after source implementation, Podman 5.8.2 CPU/GPU blocker fixes, rc5 candidate image/package assembly, local Docker CPU smoke, live Docker GPU, Docker-Desktop-free Podman CPU, Podman GPU CDI, and fixed-fixture runtime parity were validated for RC5 candidate 3
**Type**: C (Runtime Support / Podman GPU / Release Validation)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Estimated Effort**: 3-6 days (24-48 hours), split across CPU-dev-able implementation, GPU-host validation, and package release validation
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1 / post-rc4 to rc5 readiness
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-083-rc5-podman-independence-gpu-release.md`

**Objective**: Implement the RC4 follow-up fixes and Podman independence work
needed before the next release-candidate package, then build and validate an
`rc5` release artifact from the resulting branch.

**Current Direction**:
- Source implementation now covers staged-asset reuse, release manifest checksum
  metadata, Podman provider guardrails, Podman GPU CDI overlay selection,
  `enable-podman-gpu.ps1`, and focused Windows PowerShell tests.
- Podman CPU setup/import/start/status with the approved provider passed with
  evidence that Docker Desktop's bundled `docker-compose.exe` was not selected.
- Podman GPU passed through the CDI ladder on the NVIDIA WSL2 Podman host, with
  TowerScout readiness `selected_device=cuda`.
- RC5 candidate 3 passed Docker CPU, Docker GPU, Docker-Desktop-free Podman CPU,
  Podman GPU CDI, and fixed-fixture parity as runtime evidence.
- Remaining GA packaging and first-run distribution decisions are split to
  `TASK-084` rather than blocking Task-083 runtime closure.
- PR #33 merged on June 16, 2026. Further package-shape, provider-onboarding,
  and final-publication gates continue under `TASK-084` and `TASK-085`.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-066`; `TASK-074`; `TASK-075`; `TASK-080`;
`TASK-081`; `TASK-082`; RC4 follow-up and Podman GPU implementation review
analysis dated 2026-06-15; a Windows 11 WSL2 NVIDIA Podman host for final GPU
validation.

**User Value**: Converts the RC4 findings into a supportable next release
candidate that can honestly claim Docker-Desktop-free Podman support and, if
validation passes, gated Podman GPU support without changing model behavior.

### **TASK-084: GA Packaging Hardening And Podman Provider Onboarding**
**Status**: COMPLETED - runtime cleanup, shared asset-bundle identity, package guardrails, Podman provider onboarding, user/support docs, RC6 CPU/CUDA image publication, PR #38 Podman package asset-import stabilization, rebuilt RC6 package generation, static checks, Docker CPU smoke, Docker CUDA CPU-fallback smoke, Podman CPU smoke with approved package-local provider, CPU-package `-Gpu on` guardrail validation, Docker GPU validation, Podman GPU CDI validation, public-safe evidence summary preparation, official release handoff, official `v0.1.0-rc6` publication, and post-publication downloaded-release verification passed; `TASK-085` is merged/validated
**Type**: C (Release Packaging / Distribution / First-Run Support)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 days (16-32 hours), including runtime-defect cleanup, two-package generation, Podman provider onboarding, docs, and validation
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1 / RC5-to-GA hardening
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-084-ga-packaging-hardening-and-podman-provider-onboarding.md`

**Objective**: Turn the RC5 runtime-valid package path into a cleaner GA
distribution path by settling image flavor delivery and making Podman Compose
provider setup easier for Docker-Desktop-free users.

**Current Direction**:
- Publish both CPU and CUDA image flavors so CPU users do not need to pull the
  large CUDA image.
- Generate two digest-pinned GA control ZIP variants: `-cpu` for normal and
  non-GPU users, and `-cuda121` for support-validated NVIDIA GPU users.
- Use one shared Model & Data Package ZIP for both variants unless an explicit
  asset difference is introduced; both manifests must record the same asset
  bundle filename and SHA-256.
- Detect stale `.env` image/digest mismatches against package metadata and give
  clear repair guidance instead of silently launching the wrong image.
- Reject `-Gpu on` from the CPU package with package-aware guidance to use the
  CUDA package for GPU validation.
- Keep air-gapped/offline install out of scope for this task.
- Do not bundle a third-party Compose provider binary in the GA package.
- Keep the Podman path fail-closed against Docker Desktop's bundled Compose
  provider while adding approved provider auto-detect and an explicit online
  fetch-and-verify helper.
- Implement provider auto-detect through a machine-readable allowlist and fail
  ambiguous detection with candidate details unless `PODMAN_COMPOSE_PROVIDER`
  is explicit.
- Make the provider helper print the `.env` setting by default and write only
  with `-Apply`, backing up `.env` and updating only
  `PODMAN_COMPOSE_PROVIDER`.
- Implemented and focused-tested the RC5 review runtime-defect cleanup:
  Podman `cp` fallback lookup, Podman GPU image resolution, real command
  timeouts, and complete stopped-port-conflict reporting.
- Include `SOURCE.txt`, exact source ref, SBOM/provenance, package checksums,
  image digests, shared asset checksum, and manifest consistency in final
  evidence.
- Treat the dataset ZIP restore traversal gate as closed after `TASK-085`
  merged through PR #35 and passed focused validation.
- Require final CUDA package validation on both Docker GPU and Podman GPU CDI;
  hold or label the CUDA package as pre-release/support-only if GPU evidence is
  unavailable.
- Sanitize public evidence packets so even masked provider-key previews are
  removed before attachment to public release materials.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-083`; `TASK-066`; `TASK-071`; `TASK-074`; release image
workflow and package generation scripts; published CPU and CUDA image digests;
connected provider-helper download availability during support setup;
`TASK-085` is satisfied for the pre-final-package security gate after PR #35.

**User Value**: Reduces download size and first-run confusion for CPU users,
while making the Docker-Desktop-free Podman path easier to execute without
weakening the provider guardrail validated in RC5.

### **TASK-085: Dataset ZIP Restore Path Traversal Hardening**
**Status**: COMPLETED - source hardening and focused validation passed on June 16, 2026; keep active until sprint closeout
**Type**: C (Security / Dataset Restore Hardening)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 0.5-1 day (4-8 hours)
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1 / pre-final-package gate
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-085-dataset-zip-restore-path-traversal-hardening.md`

**Objective**: Harden dataset ZIP restore so uploaded dataset archives cannot
write outside the session temp directory through traversal, absolute paths,
backslashes, drive prefixes, or adapted restore targets that resolve outside
the intended root.

**Current Direction**:
- Validate every ZIP member path before old-stem detection, filename
  adaptation, or file writes.
- Reject `..`, `.`, empty path segments, absolute paths, backslashes, drive or
  scheme prefixes, and null bytes with a 400 support-safe error.
- Resolve adapted restore targets and verify they remain below the session
  temp directory before writing.
- Preserve valid TowerScout dataset export/restore behavior.
- This hard pre-final-package gate for `TASK-084` is now closed after PR #35.

**Dependencies**: Current `/uploaddataset` route and dataset export/restore
tests; `TASK-084` final package sequencing.

**User Value**: Keeps the investigation export/restore workflow while closing
a release-blocking archive path traversal risk before broader package
distribution.

### **TASK-086: Provider TLS Auto-Repair And Setup Triage**
**Status**: VALIDATION_PACKAGE_STAGED_PENDING_MANAGED_NETWORK_PROOF - internal `tls-validation-2026-06-26` CPU/CUDA package variants, images, tag, and published prerelease are staged; managed-network repair proof remains before the next official tester-facing package
**Type**: B/C (Runtime Support / Provider Setup / TLS Trust)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days (24-40 hours) plus one managed-network validation pass
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 post-RC6 UAT follow-up / next pilot package
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-086-provider-tls-auto-repair-and-setup-triage.md`

**Objective**: Add a guided, support-safe provider TLS diagnosis and repair
path that reduces manual Windows certificate thumbprint hunting when Google
Maps or Azure Maps validation fails inside the container on a managed
TLS-inspected network, while centralizing provider HTTP/TLS handling and
improving Setup Wizard triage for invalid-key versus TLS trust failures.

**Completed Implementation**:
- Added shared provider HTTP/TLS handling across validation, geocoding, map
  proxy, async imagery downloads, keyless TLS preflight, and redacted provider
  URL surfaces.
- Added `scripts/repair-provider-tls.ps1/.cmd` as the guided dry-run-first
  support wrapper, with `-Provider`, `-Engine`, `-Gpu`, `-Thumbprint`,
  `-CertificatePath`, and explicit `-Apply` semantics. Apply mode delegates to
  `scripts/import-tls-ca.cmd`.
- Updated Setup Wizard and Settings to preserve structured backend
  `details`/`category`/`support_action`/`repair_command` fields, allow Azure to
  persist when Google needs TLS repair and Azure is selected/default, and avoid
  treating repairable TLS failures as bad keys.
- Updated Docker CPU/GPU, Podman CPU/GPU, Quick Start, Package Guide, OCI
  support docs, runtime contract, and `.env.example` so the guided repair
  helper is the preferred path and low-level `import-tls-ca` is support
  fallback.
- Added focused tests for helper safety text/delegation, provider/GPU
  forwarding, category mapping, frontend structured-error preservation,
  read-only TLS status, map proxy/imagery redaction, and package inclusion.

**Latest Validation**:
- `node webapp\build.js` passed.
- PowerShell parser checks passed for `scripts/repair-provider-tls.ps1` and
  `scripts/import-tls-ca.ps1`.
- `python -m py_compile` passed for changed Python backend modules.
- Focused pytest suite passed: 110 tests.
- `git diff --check` passed.
- `python .agent_work\scripts\validate_agent_work.py` passed.
- Internal validation release package correction passed manifest, sidecar
  checksum, and package `SHA256SUMS.txt` verification for both
  `tls-validation-2026-06-26-cpu` and
  `tls-validation-2026-06-26-cuda121`.

**Remaining**:
- Internal `tls-validation-2026-06-26` CPU and CUDA 12.1 Application Package
  ZIPs plus the shared Model & Data Package ZIP are staged at
  `dist\tls-validation-2026-06-26`, tagged on GitHub, and attached to the
  published validation prerelease at
  `https://github.com/J-Schulein/TowerScout/releases/tag/tls-validation-2026-06-26`.
  Run the managed-network proof path before promoting the verified flow into
  the next official tester-facing package.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-073`; `TASK-074`; `TASK-080`; `TASK-084`; current
`scripts/import-tls-ca.*`, `scripts/launch.ps1`, provider validation, setup
wizard, package docs, and a managed-network validation environment.

**User Value**: Converts a repeated UAT support blocker into a guided repair
workflow, reducing the chance that valid Google provider setup stalls because a
tester or support contact cannot safely identify the correct local TLS
inspection CA.

### **TASK-074: Runtime Prerequisite Preflight**
**Status**: COMPLETED - post-merge package-artifact bootstrap validation passed
**Type**: B/C (Launcher / Supportability / Release UX)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days (8-16 hours) for RC1 MVP
**Target Sprint**: Sprint 06 V1 RC1
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-074-runtime-prerequisite-preflight.md`

**Objective**: Implement a Windows package bootstrap/preflight layer that reduces first-launch friction for V1 RC1 users while preserving the validated release package boundaries.

**Current Direction**:
- Keep Docker Desktop as the primary RC1 pilot path.
- Keep Podman as a qualified support-directed path when a running Podman machine and approved Compose provider are available.
- A top-level `bootstrap.cmd` now delegates to `scripts/bootstrap.ps1`, with reusable helper functions in `scripts/lib/TowerScoutBootstrap.ps1`.
- Bootstrap checks engine readiness, Compose availability, WSL/virtualization hints, disk space, port availability, checksums, release/version matching, asset ZIP layout, readiness state, and support-safe next actions.
- Asset ZIP handling now extracts to temporary staging before final promotion so failed manifest/release validation does not leave final asset entries behind.
- A follow-up patch ensures `-VerifyOnly -AssetZip` checks the ZIP without final asset staging and exits before mutation.
- A follow-up patch also initializes package `.env` from `.env.example` before packaged Compose-entry paths start the stack, preventing fresh packages from falling back to the default `latest` image instead of the pinned package digest.
- Bootstrap reuses existing `scripts/import-assets.ps1 -VerifyHashes` and `scripts/launch.ps1`; `start.bat` remains the direct launch path after setup.
- Do not claim hosted asset download, native installer behavior, OCI image archives, Docker-Desktop-free Podman beyond validated boundaries, or GPU support beyond `TASK-075` evidence.

**Dependencies**: `TASK-071`; `TASK-073`; `TASK-066`; `TASK-075`; current launch/import/status scripts.

**User Value**: Converts the most error-prone first-launch checks into guided, plain-English support output before broad external UAT, reducing the chance that non-command-line users get stuck on engine setup, release-file mismatch, asset layout, or readiness interpretation.

## Policy Lane Candidates

These tasks are important for V1 RC1, but they are not yet active task files in this planning update. Pull them into `current-tasks.md` and create active task docs if owner/legal availability or release risk requires formal Sprint 06 commitment.

| Task | Recommended Handling | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `TASK-076` Provider API Key Exposure And Restriction Policy | Candidate for parallel Sprint 06 work | Browser map SDK keys remain client-visible; v1 needs an approved restriction/support policy or an engineering blocker. AGPL does not change provider/API terms. |

---

## Backlog Candidates To Watch

Do not forget these follow-through tasks. They are intentionally kept in `.agent_work/task-backlog.md` rather than pulled into the active sprint now, but `TASK-066` findings may justify selecting one or more before external UAT.

| Task | Pull Into Sprint 06 If | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `TASK-068` Windows Test Portability And Script Validation | Script validation remains environment-sensitive, Flask route tests load local runtime config, or PowerShell/Windows coverage is needed before external UAT. | Useful release-support follow-through, especially around Windows-first helper scripts and isolating tests from local `.env`, logs, uploads, sessions, and cache paths. |
| `TASK-077` Public Release Manifest And Asset Import Hardening | `TASK-069` AGPL release compliance needs a package payload, or `TASK-066` shows copy-then-verify import is too risky. | Pull forward the narrow compliance-payload slice now: release manifest, source URL/ref, checksums, image digest, SBOM reference, model/data terms, and revocation notes. Keep staged allowlist-only asset activation as follow-up unless validation makes it release-critical. |

---

## Sprint 06 Planning Guardrails

- Treat Sprint 06 as a V1 RC1 / pilot-ready release-readiness sprint, not final V1 completion.
- Do not start broad end-user testing until `TASK-069`, `TASK-072`, `TASK-071`, and `TASK-066` have produced a validated AGPL-compliant package/docs/assets path.
- Do not start V2 work until pilot/UAT blockers are fixed or explicitly accepted.
- Keep architecture follow-on work (`TASK-058`, `TASK-059`) behind release-candidate readiness unless the team intentionally pauses release work.
- Keep parked tail work (`TASK-028`, `TASK-061`, Advanced Filtering, Performance Dashboard, User Preferences) out of Sprint 06 unless new evidence makes one of them release-critical.
