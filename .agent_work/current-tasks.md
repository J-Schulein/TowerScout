# Current Tasks - Final Candidate Build And Acceptance

**Sprint Period**: October 5-October 16, 2026
**Last Updated**: October 7, 2026
**Focus**: Qualify a dependable, downloadable Windows 11 application from
accepted `main` across Docker/Podman and CPU/NVIDIA profiles. Documentation
content is frozen and merged through PR #94, and the project-state
reconciliation is merged through PR #95. The same-source RC8 CPU/CUDA images
now pass the exact-digest security gate, and their digest-pinned control ZIPs
are assembled, verified, and published as the non-Latest RC8 validation
prerelease. Final browser-download and independent-host acceptance follow.
The Task-087 launcher
redesign remains preserved and deferred, not a release gate.

**Historical `rc4` Control-Package Source**: `541622556fb7999ee4e88fb1e44f7797b9da34f5`

**Confirmed `rc4` Runtime Image Source**: `541622556fb7999ee4e88fb1e44f7797b9da34f5`
**Accepted Documentation Content Source**: `fc97b3200785d307b39ef5a683979002a5f409e6`
**Preliminary Local RC5 Source**: `a24d369668d27240ed0baa184d071395455b9c95`
**Frozen Publishable Candidate Source**:
`7827c2af8ecb7d8b21d246b69e135807fa497fd2`. The same-source
`v0.1.0-rc8` CPU and CUDA 12.8 images passed local and exact-published-digest
security qualification with `push_latest=false`. The control packages bind only
those exact pinned manifest digests and are published in the RC8 validation
prerelease. No `latest` image tag or stable GitHub release was promoted.
**Authoritative Branch**: `main`
**Decision**: [ADR-021](./decisions/021-main-based-windows-deployment-deadline.md)
**ML Runtime Amendment**: [ADR-022](./decisions/022-cuda128-blackwell-ml-runtime.md)
**Windows Package Policy**: [ADR-023](./decisions/023-unsigned-windows-package-support-boundary.md)
**RC5 Security Boundary**: [ADR-024](./decisions/024-rc5-security-gate-and-residual-boundary.md)
**Acceptance**: [Windows deployment prioritization v2](./context/status/Reprioritization%20Effort/2026-09-21-windows-deployment-prioritization-v2.md)
**Work Plan**: [Windows deployment hardening v2](./context/status/Reprioritization%20Effort/2026-09-21-windows-deployment-hardening-v2.md)

## Current Release State

- The published `v0.1.2` pilot remains immutable.
- New work starts from accepted `main`; PRs #64/#67 were not merged or
  reconciled and their exact heads are preserved by archive tags.
- The Task-103 `rc4` CPU and CUDA 12.8 (`cuda128`) images have distinct
  confirmed digests. W09 control packages are assembled and locally qualified
  from accepted source. Because `docs/` is also baked into the images and
  served in-app, the ADR-023/Task-092 documentation refresh requires new
  documentation-aligned image and control-package identities before final
  distribution. Package publication and `latest` remain owner-gated.
- `J-Schulein` approved the documentation content freeze at `524ba37`. The
  bounded post-freeze reproducibility corrections landed at `f8e191d`, PR #94
  merged as `fc97b32`, and post-merge CI passed. No documentation review
  blocker remained for the now-completed clean-source RC8 rebuild.
- PR #95 merged the bounded project-state reconciliation as `a24d369`. PR #96
  then merged the application `urllib3==2.8.0` correction as `b0725e7`; all
  applicable post-merge checks passed. Retained Trivy evidence shows that ten
  of the 14 new HIGH keys come from unused Debian packages pulled in by
  `gdal-bin`; the other four are pip-private urllib3 and Bookworm OpenSSL
  records. ADR-024 authorizes removing `gdal-bin` and accepting only those four
  exact records through October 31, 2026 using a fail-closed residual file.
  TASK-104 implements that boundary and the scan-before-push workflow. The
  396-key baseline remains unchanged.
- PRs #97-#100 merged the ADR-024 implementation, shell-quoting correction,
  transport-safe config-identity rule, read-only exact-digest recovery, and
  immutable-tag overwrite/race protection. Owner-authorized CPU and CUDA 12.8
  dispatches for `v0.1.0-rc5` with `push_latest=false` then passed. CPU
  verification run `37663225514` qualified exact registry manifest
  `sha256:8e624a332a0b70ce70a6d29625d8482bb04651767d38d21e46cac16932b65bee`
  without replacing its tag. CUDA publish run `37663527863` qualified exact
  registry manifest
  `sha256:e50a43293d07c6904b103201f65b142cc38267d4d263be67e702c672628dbfec`.
  Each exact-digest comparison reported baseline 396, candidate 78, accepted
  baseline 74, accepted temporary residuals 4, blocking 0, severity
  escalations 0, and resolved 322. No `latest` promotion step ran and no
  package was published. The individually qualified images have different
  source labels, so final paired-package identity remains intentionally
  unfrozen pending an owner traceability decision.
- PR #101 recorded the RC5 evidence and merged as
  `7827c2af8ecb7d8b21d246b69e135807fa497fd2` after exact-head and
  post-merge checks passed. Historical `v0.1.0-rc6-cpu` and
  `v0.1.0-rc7-cpu` tags already existed from June source and were preserved;
  `v0.1.0-rc8` was the first unused CPU/CUDA pair. Owner-authorized CPU run
  `37674158762` and CUDA run `37674161407` both passed build/load, the local
  dependency/Fiona and Trivy gates, immutable-tag absence, push/config
  identity, exact-published-digest Trivy/SBOM, and final comparison. The frozen
  manifests are CPU
  `sha256:2e040c3b09d1aa493b205ec2100c112a839ab7a9bfc90a639f73918e06135412`
  and CUDA 12.8
  `sha256:712beb4e143495ba72705cc56b89a939c5bebfdc47dc2f6d0694c81e9e60ca57`.
  Both carry the exact `7827c2a` source label and passed with baseline 396,
  candidate 78, accepted baseline 74, accepted residual 4, blocking 0,
  severity escalations 0, and resolved 322. Both `latest` steps were skipped;
  no control package or release was published. A clean detached checkout of
  `7827c2a` then produced local control ZIPs with SHA-256
  `8fd46711b57a25dd71cd879a06fe519674596ee9a71fa66b2347204fe8bc74f0`
  (CPU) and
  `463d3f2348e369ed647bb8ed66c15588fc4051197e49ac90441552b8318bdada`
  (CUDA 12.8). Both manifests, outer sidecars, all 73 internal checksums, and
  the focused `7/7` package tests passed. The retained browser-downloaded asset
  ZIP remains byte-identical to the required RC8 asset at SHA-256
  `00599cc4fe9f2bdb4708c669d7c3d9a8a570a0c3b547bc5c317026196c7bacbb`;
  it was not duplicated locally merely to rename it.
- Full readiness requires actual YOLO and EfficientNet work on the required
  device in all four profiles plus independent-computer reproduction.
- Static checks, health/readiness, mocked tests, or CPU fallback are not
  substitutes for the required runtime evidence.
- ADR-023 resolves the signing/policy choice: the standard Windows package is
  unsigned and supports only users/sites that permit its supplied wrappers.
  Signature-enforcing managed endpoints are outside the standard claim.
- Missing machines, assets, provider accounts, authoritative download hashes,
  or failed tests are blockers and must remain visible in the forecast.
- cdcai adoption and external publication remain owner-authorized actions.

## Active Delivery Work

### **TASK-103: CUDA 12.8 Blackwell ML Runtime**

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - local `rc4` images/packages pass G10, exact-digest
W05, four-profile W09, and all first-host provider/recovery/review-export/
controlled-error/reboot cells. ADR-023 resolves the unsigned support boundary,
the bounded `rc4` browser-download Docker CPU diagnostic passed without a
larger blocker, and its documentation findings are merged through PR #94.
PR #95 then reconciled the accepted project state, and PR #96 merged the
application urllib3 correction. ADR-024/TASK-104 security correction and the
same-source RC8 CPU/CUDA exact-digest registry gates now pass. The
digest-pinned control packages are assembled and locally verified; publish the
approved candidate assets, then complete final browser-download plus
independent-host evidence
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-103-cuda128-blackwell-ml-runtime.md`

Current scope:

- Adopt torch 2.10.0/torchvision 0.25.0 with distinct `cpu` and `cuda128`
  image/package identities under ADR-022.
- Complete gates-v3, RGB input, recovery-message, source-build, CI/security,
  documentation, governance, Podman, rollback, and compliance work.
- Qualify rebased CPU/CUDA images with real models and preserve every run;
  missing external cells remain blocked rather than inferred.
- Preserve the accepted-baseline scan gate, comparator hardening, sanitized
  evidence, and code-scanning disposition merged through PR #86.
- Keep the confirmed `rc4` CPU/CUDA runtime evidence. The `rc4` images and
  control ZIPs remain the regression baseline but are not the final
  documentation-aligned distribution: repository `docs/` is copied into both
  surfaces. The same-source RC8 image and package rebuild is complete. Do not
  promote `latest` or publish a stable/general release without separate owner
  authorization; the RC8 validation prerelease was separately authorized.

### **TASK-104: RC5 Security Gate And Residual Disposition**

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - ADR-024 implementation and local CPU/CUDA security,
identity, Fiona/ZCTA, real-model/device, and live Azure/Google ZCTA-provider
proof pass. The same-source RC8 CPU and CUDA 12.8 registry digests pass the
strict exact-digest gate with no `latest` promotion, and their digest-pinned
control ZIPs pass local integrity validation. Security/publication correction,
local package assembly, and the non-Latest RC8 validation prerelease are
complete; final browser-download and independent-host acceptance remain
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-104-rc5-security-gate-and-residual-disposition.md`

Current scope:

- Keep the 396-key accepted baseline unchanged.
- Pin candidate bases/pip, remove Debian GDAL and its unused transitive tree,
  and prove Fiona/ZCTA behavior through the bundled library.
- Match only the exact pip-private urllib3 and Bookworm OpenSSL records in the
  owner-approved, expiring residual file.
- Build/load/scan locally before any push; verify registry config identity and
  exact-digest scan/SBOM evidence before any `latest` promotion.

### **TASK-095: Governance And AI-Ready Handoff Foundation**

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - W00 alignment complete; Phase B handoff governance continues
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-095-governance-ai-ready-handoff.md`

Current scope:

- Make the v2 main-based plan discoverable from active entrypoints.
- Remove PR #67/Task-087 resume gates from current execution direction while
  preserving their history.
- Correct misleading release-critical skill commands and evidence guidance.
- Keep the active board, backlog, requirements, design, and handoff consistent.

### **TASK-091: Owner-Runnable Release Qualification**

**Status**: AT_RISK - local `rc4` W05/W09 and four-profile first-host
provider, cancellation/error recovery, review/export, and stop/relaunch cells
pass, including exact-`rc4` reboot persistence. ADR-023 resolves policy/signing
by narrowing the supported environment. The preliminary `rc4` browser-download
Docker CPU diagnostic passed and now informs Task-092; it does not replace the
final exact-candidate browser-download and independent-host evidence
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-091-owner-runnable-release-qualification.md`

Current scope:

- Record accepted source, host/runtime availability, candidate/package/assets,
  ADR-023 policy inputs, fixtures, and provider-account prerequisites.
- Attempt an extracted real control-package setup immediately when verified
  package and asset ZIPs are available; do not substitute a source build.
- Use `rc4` first for a clearly labeled, non-qualifying browser-download
  diagnostic; preserve findings, then repeat final acceptance against the
  documentation-aligned image/package identities.
- Extend truthful external combined-model qualification under W05, then bind
  W09/W10 evidence to exact ZIP hashes and image digests.
- Report `pass`, `fail`, `blocked`, `not_run`, or justified `not_applicable`;
  never infer readiness from an absent prerequisite.

### **TASK-097: Podman CPU/GPU Final Path Qualification**

**Status**: AT_RISK - the approved relative package-local provider passes from
spaced paths on rootless Podman 6.0.2. Exact `rc4` CPU/CUDA startup, live
Google/Azure workflows, cancellation/error recovery, review/export, restart,
volume retention, and CUDA `sm_120` execution pass on the first host; the
documented Python 3.12 prerequisite and independent-host proof remain
**Priority**: HIGH
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-097-podman-final-path-qualification.md`

Current scope:

- Qualify Podman without Docker Desktop using the approved Compose provider and
  documented Python prerequisite.
- Bind operations to the intended machine/connection and fail before mutation
  on a target mismatch.
- Require CPU inference and NVIDIA CDI CUDA inference with no silent fallback.

### **TASK-092: Documentation Currentness And Information Architecture**

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - `rc4` and five review rounds are dispositioned;
`J-Schulein` approved the content freeze at `524ba37`, bounded follow-up fixes
landed at `f8e191d`, PR #94 merged as `fc97b32`, and PR #95 merged the bounded
state reconciliation as `a24d369`. Local `rc5` image/package documentation
parity passes, the same-source RC8 image identities are frozen, and their
digest-pinned control ZIPs are published in the RC8 validation prerelease.
Complete live permission verification, exact-browser-downloaded-package/
running-image Help validation, publication checks, screenshots/video, and the
final W09/W10 gates
**Priority**: HIGH
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-092-documentation-currentness.md`

Current scope:

- Keep active agent/task directions aligned with the main-based delivery.
- Update public and in-app instructions only against observed package behavior
  and exact accepted artifact identities.
- Execute the detailed child plan at
  `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-092/wiki-information-architecture.md`; keep
  exact release instructions available offline and avoid independently
  maintained Wiki/package duplication.
- Account for `docs/` in both control ZIPs and OCI images; verify running-app
  Help against the documentation-aligned image before final acceptance.
- Preserve historical pilot documentation as clearly historical.

### **TASK-093: Persistent Data Lifecycle And Recovery Rehearsal**

**Status**: IN_PROGRESS - exact `rc4` first-host cancellation/error recovery,
review/export, volume-preserving stop/relaunch, and reboot persistence pass in
all four profiles; independent-host repetition remains
**Priority**: HIGH
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-093-persistent-data-recovery.md`

Current scope:

- Preserve all eight named volumes and successful review/export inputs.
- Prove stop/relaunch, reboot, cancellation/error recovery, and a successful
  next request on the exact candidate.
- Rehearse rollback/recovery without destructive volume cleanup.

## Preserved, Completed, Deferred, Or Owner-Gated Work

### **TASK-087: Host-Side TLS Repair Control Plane**

**Status**: ARCHIVED / DEFERRED - PRs #64/#67 closed without merge; future work
requires a new task and branch from then-current `main`
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-087-host-side-tls-repair-control-plane.md`

The exact PR heads, launcher code, and review/evidence history are preserved by
archive tags and the
[final disposition record](./context/archive/2026-09/TASK-087-PR64-PR67-FINAL-DISPOSITION-2026-09-24.md).
Do not merge, reconcile, extend, resume, or repeatedly review those branches as
a deployment prerequisite. The existing command-based lifecycle and TLS paths
remain the release path; only bounded defects reproduced there are in scope.

### **TASK-089: cdcai Adoption Preparation And Deferred Ownership Transfer**

**Status**: BLOCKED / OWNER-GATED - local preparation only
**Task File**: `.agent_work/tasks/active/TASK-089-cdcai-migration-execution.md`

No cdcai mutation or external publication occurs without owner qualification
and explicit authorization.

## Delivery Sequence And Checkpoints

1. [x] Complete W00 entrypoint, decision, task, and release-critical skill
   alignment; pass the strict `.agent_work` validator and contradiction review.
2. [x] Complete W01 inventory and attempt a real downloaded/extracted package
   install as soon as verified control and asset ZIPs are available.
3. [x] Record the Day-1 forecast as `go`, `at_risk`, or `blocked`, with each
   blocker, owner, and next check named.
4. [x] Select, review, and merge the evidence-required W02-W08 fixes and W05
   harness through PRs #77-#83; runtime acceptance proof remains.
5. [x] By Day 3, require a corrected Docker/Podman rehearsal plus real combined
   inference or revise the forecast.
6. [x] Freeze exact W09 source/images/ZIPs/assets/fixtures/tools before final
   distribution.
7. [x] Run the preserved `rc4` browser-download shakedown as preliminary
   diagnostic evidence, then incorporate applicable findings into Task-092.
8. [x] Freeze Task-092 content, merge the accepted documentation through PR
   #94, and confirm post-merge CI.
9. [x] Complete ADR-024/TASK-104, merge the bounded security correction,
   freeze the reconciled accepted-main source, and rebuild and locally verify
   documentation-aligned CPU/CUDA images and control ZIPs under the RC8
   identities.
10. [x] After owner authorization, publish the exact RC8 assets and
   authoritative hashes before final browser-download extraction testing or
   tester distribution.
11. [ ] Complete W10 four-profile and independent-host reproduction; otherwise
   report only the exact qualified subset.

## Runtime Coordination

State the engine/profile before runtime work and verify it is available. When
the current session grants W00-W10 implementation scope, routine validation may
continue without repeated approval for every command. If Docker Desktop,
Podman, a restart, or another external prerequisite is unavailable, record the
blocker and continue safe non-runtime work. Never delete named volumes or mutate
an unverified Compose/Podman target.
