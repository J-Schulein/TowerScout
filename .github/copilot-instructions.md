# TowerScout AI Coding Guide

This is the primary high-context guidance file for AI coding agents working in
the TowerScout repository. It preserves project context, guardrails, and
workflow guidance while reflecting the current repository state as of
2026-08-19.

## Mission and Product Context

TowerScout is a Flask web application for identifying cooling towers from satellite and aerial imagery using a YOLOv5 detector plus an EfficientNet secondary classifier. It began as a graduate project, but the repo and surrounding workflow are now oriented around practical outbreak-investigation and registry-building use cases rather than a purely academic prototype.

The project still carries public-health workflow expectations:

- support fast area definition and tower detection
- preserve manual review and manual correction workflows
- preserve export and restoration workflows for iterative investigation and labeling
- keep Google Maps and Azure Maps workflows operational
- keep the path open for non-technical local deployment

## Current Repository Status

### Current State

- Sprint 09 is the active planning and execution lane.
- Sprint 04 through Sprint 07 are completed background context.
- Setup Wizard and Settings are implemented in the repo.
- Detection progress, estimate/detect separation, and cancel handling are implemented in the repo.
- `TASK-025` Docker-compatible / OCI containerization is merged on `main`: the repo now has a `Dockerfile`, Compose configuration, health/readiness endpoints, persistent runtime volume contract, release-package helper scripts, GHCR publish workflow, asset/TLS import helpers, and OCI runtime documentation.
- The current release direction remains GitHub-first and engine-aware: GitHub
  Releases are the normal user-facing release control plane, and a release ZIP
  plus pinned GHCR image digest is the preferred package shape.
- `TASK-071`, `TASK-072`, and `TASK-079` are complete enough to feed the stable-release closeout path. `TASK-075` has implemented the single GPU-capable package direction with CPU-safe default launch; broad GPU acceleration claims remain bounded by workstation-specific NVIDIA validation.
- `TASK-066` has validated the digest-pinned Docker Desktop and Podman package runtime paths for CPU-default launch. Podman evidence is qualified: on the validation host, `podman compose` delegated to Docker Compose v5.1.3, and Podman source-build/base-image pulls from Docker Hub still fail TLS certificate verification inside the Podman VM.
- `TASK-067` has closed the Flask route-test timeout/isolation gap with pytest timeout safeguards and isolated test runtime paths.
- PR #46 has merged on `main` as `d148727`, closing the non-mutating Task-087 Gate 3 proof while keeping the helper control plane dark.
- The fork-side `v0.1.2` release is published and passed the full Docker/Podman CPU/CUDA validation matrix with both Google and Azure providers. It is the frozen validated pilot baseline.
- `TASK-088` is complete: the pilot was distributed, support coverage was confirmed, and release/evidence custody was recorded.
- The cdcai owner selected a fix-first path. Keep `v0.1.2` immutable while the
  fork develops `v0.1.3-rc.N` candidates.
- `TASK-095` Phase A rebaselined the roadmap and `.agent_work`; Phase B
  governance continues through handoff.
- `TASK-090` and `TASK-098` are complete. PR #51 merged the qualified
  dependency remediation as `e499b50`, post-merge CI passed, and Dependabot
  reconciled on July 27 to eight documented non-blocking torch advisories.
- `TASK-099` is complete for Dependabot alerts `#72-#75` and npm audit finding
  `GHSA-5p4m-2wfm-xmqj`. PRs #68/#69 merged as `f460445`/`0133b50`; main CI
  and root graph refresh passed, alert `#74` closed without dismissal, and
  its August 11 closeout inventory contained the eight documented torch
  residuals.
- `TASK-101` is active for high-severity development-transitive `extract-zip`
  alert `#76`. The finding is not shipped in the product runtime, but a
  maintained browser-install path can execute it and the frontend audit blocks.
- `TASK-087` is paused on Task-101. Draft PR #67 remains open for reviewer
  input; new implementation, merge, and candidate publication wait for
  Task-101 acceptance.
- `TASK-096` adds user-confirmed Exit/Stop. `TASK-097` qualifies Podman CPU/GPU.
- Docker CPU, Docker GPU, Podman CPU, and Podman GPU are required final-package
  profiles, subject to their documented prerequisites.
- `TASK-089` remains owner-gated. Do not change `cdcai/TowerScout` until the
  final candidate is qualified and the owner explicitly approves adoption.
- The project ends 2026-10-31, with operational closeout on 2026-10-30. Pilot
  feedback remains in the project lead's external fillable Word document.

### Completed Sprint 04 Summary

Sprint 04 moved the repo from a "major usability and stabilization work still pending" state into a late pre-containerization state. The sprint started with Setup Wizard delivery as the primary objective, but it expanded into a broader closeout of setup/configuration, logging, performance quick wins, stale-surface cleanup, detection-workflow stabilization, live browser validation, and UI polish.

Sprint 04 records `TASK-046`, `TASK-047`, `TASK-048`, `TASK-049`, `TASK-050`, `TASK-053`, and the `ISSUE-003` follow-up work as complete.

**Sprint 04 Bundle Evolution:**
- frontend bundle size grew from `412.8 KB` to `446.1 KB` (`+33.3 KB`) as setup/configuration flows, progress status UX, logging improvements, and stabilized detection-workflow behavior were added

**Sprint 04 Objective:**
- eliminate manual `.env` editing through first-launch setup and in-app settings
- improve operational polish and end-user clarity
- validate and stabilize the live detection workflow before containerization work begins

**Sprint 04 Major Accomplishments:**

1. **Setup and Configuration Became First-Class Runtime Features**
   - `TASK-046` landed `ts_config.py`, config validation/save/status/reset/performance endpoints, setup-required boot mode, Setup Wizard, Settings, `.env` persistence, masked key previews, and runtime config refresh.
   - The repo no longer depends on users editing config files by hand for normal setup.

2. **Logging and UX Were Tightened for Real End Users**
   - `TASK-048` converted the settings debug toggle into a real browser-console gating mechanism.
   - `TowerScoutLogger` now supports layered status messaging so users still see useful in-app output when debug mode is off.
   - `TASK-047` added main-screen polish, settings readability improvements, longer polygon-complete notifications, and the lightweight progress-overlay phase/status UX.

3. **Performance Investigation Produced Bounded, Shipped Wins**
   - `ISSUE-003` established evidence-backed profiling instead of anecdotal performance assumptions.
   - Azure overlay hot-path lookups were indexed to remove repeated full-shape scans.
   - Follow-up quick wins reduced unnecessary EfficientNet debug-image writes, redundant frontend hydration/visibility passes, and metadata-only overlay allocation.

4. **Detection Workflow Stabilization Became a Dedicated Workstream**
   - `TASK-053` added or stabilized estimate/detect separation, live progress plumbing, cancel lifecycle cleanup, provider-aware geocoding behavior, duplicate suppression, restore correctness, and browser-validated Google/Azure detection flows.
   - Live browser validation was restored as a maintained workflow through Puppeteer smoke coverage and manual browser QA.
   - The sprint treated setup/settings, export/restore, manual towers, and provider behavior as explicit non-regression surfaces rather than incidental side effects.

5. **Cleanup and Audit Work Clarified the Path to Sprint 05**
   - `TASK-050` produced a full-repo stale-code/performance audit.
   - `TASK-049` removed low-risk tracked artifacts, repaired the pytest collection gate, and archived stale helper/test surfaces without discarding historical context.
   - Remaining work was cleanly split into `TASK-051` and `TASK-052` so container work can start from a narrower, better-defined foundation.

**Sprint 04 Outcome:**

Sprint 04 materially changed what an agent should assume about the project. The repo is no longer best described as "missing setup, logging discipline, and stable live detection behavior." A better current mental model is:

- setup and settings are implemented
- progress and cancellation are implemented
- live Google/Azure detection flows have been actively browser-validated
- the main unresolved project frontier is deployment readiness, not baseline usability

### Immediate Path Forward

The current path is fix-first candidate development with feedback-gated cdcai
adoption:

1. Keep the six distributed `v0.1.2` release assets immutable.
2. Task-095 Phase A is complete.
3. Preserve the completed July Task-090/098 record and the eight documented
   torch residuals for a future coordinated ML qualification cycle.
4. Preserve Task-099's completed `aiohttp==3.14.3`, transitive
   `ip-address==10.3.1`, and transitive `js-yaml==4.3.1` remediation plus its
   eight-alert torch residual baseline.
5. Complete active Task-101's focused Node/Puppeteer remediation and required
   compatibility matrix without weakening or dismissing the blocking audit.
6. Keep Draft PR #67 reviewable; after Task-101 passes, bring the accepted
   change into that branch and resume Task-087 from its preserved checkpoint.
7. Complete Task-087 guided Google/Azure provider TLS work on Docker and
   Podman; preserve the command fallback and satisfy its remaining gates.
8. Complete Task-096 Exit/Stop and Task-097 Podman CPU/GPU qualification.
9. Qualify Docker CPU, Docker GPU, Podman CPU, and Podman GPU before freeze.
10. Use `v0.1.3-rc.N` for immutable fork-side candidates; do not publish
   `v0.1.3` final automatically.
11. Keep Task-089 preparation reversible and cdcai unchanged.
12. Select the official cdcai tag/title before the official build and execute
   adoption only after owner qualification and approval.
13. Treat Task-058/059 as conditional stretch work behind all required gates.

`TASK-026` CPU optimization and `TASK-029` multi-provider fallback remain follow-on backlog work unless release evidence makes them release-critical.

### Important Status Correction

Do not describe the project as still lacking in-app API-key management or a first-launch setup experience. Those features now exist. The next path forward is deployment readiness and validation, not re-inventing setup/settings from scratch.

## Current Runtime and Data Flow

1. Startup loads environment/config state from `webapp/config/.env` when present, or migrates from legacy `webapp/.env`.
2. App determines whether it must run in setup-required mode based on available provider keys.
3. Setup Wizard and Settings interact with config API endpoints to validate keys, persist configuration, and refresh runtime settings.
4. User defines an area via address search, ZIP code, circle, or custom polygon.
5. Frontend can estimate tiles via `POST /api/detection/estimate`.
6. Frontend runs full detection via `POST /getobjects`.
7. Backend tiles the region, downloads imagery, runs YOLOv5, conditionally applies EfficientNet, deduplicates detections, reverse-geocodes results, and stores workflow state in the session.
8. Frontend polls `GET /api/detection/progress` for live progress detail and supports user cancellation.
9. Results are displayed on the map and in the review panel, then exported or restored as needed.

## Production-Critical Legacy Requirements

These expectations from the original guidance remain valid and should still be treated as high-priority preservation constraints unless the user explicitly asks to change them:

### Core Detection Workflow

- machine learning-based cooling tower detection with confidence scores
- multi-provider imagery support using Google Maps and Azure Maps
- confidence filtering and result toggling
- automatic address geocoding for detections

### Search and Navigation

- location search
- ZIP code search
- polygon search
- circular search
- tile estimation before long-running detection work
- map pan/zoom/drag behavior with provider switching

### Review and Editing

- interactive map overlays with clickable results
- right-panel review flow
- bidirectional highlight behavior between list and map
- false-positive deselection
- manual tower addition
- tile review and tower review modes

### Export and Investigation Workflow

- CSV export
- KML export
- dataset export/restore
- provenance between ML detections and manual detections
- support for outbreak investigation and registry workflows

## Current User-Facing Capabilities

### Setup and Configuration

- setup-required boot mode when no valid provider key is configured
- first-launch Setup Wizard
- API-key validation against provider endpoints
- default-provider selection
- performance summary display in setup/settings flows
- settings modal with masked previews, save path, debug toggle, and cache/session reset
- runtime reload of configuration after successful save

### Detection Workflow

- estimate-first workflow via dedicated estimate route
- full detection with progress overlay
- cancel support during active detection
- live progress phase titles and details
- provider-aware reverse geocoding
- duplicate suppression before geocoding

### Review and Data Management

- confidence filtering
- review mode toggles
- manual tower creation and saving
- dataset restore via `contents.txt`
- CSV/KML/YOLO/XML export behavior

### Search and Provider UX

- Google search via `PlaceAutocompleteElement`
- Azure search via service SDK
- custom Google polygon drawing instead of deprecated `DrawingManager`
- Azure native drawing tooling
- provider switching with shared app state

## Security Status and Validation Reality

### Security Work Already Completed

- API keys are no longer stored in `apikey.txt`
- environment/config-based key handling is implemented
- sensitive values are sanitized in logging
- settings/status responses mask keys

### Validation Already Implemented

The original document listed several of these as missing, but they are now implemented:

- polygon coordinate validation
- polygon geometry validation
- bounds validation
- provider validation
- engine validation
- search query sanitization
- dataset/image/model upload validation
- route-level rate limiting

### Current Provider Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_MAPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`
- `DEFAULT_MAP_PROVIDER`
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`

### Legacy Compatibility Note

`BING_API_KEY` still appears in the repo and backend provider-loading logic as a legacy compatibility surface. Do not treat Bing as the primary path forward, but do not delete or ignore the compatibility implications without checking current usage.

## Key Runtime Patterns

### Session Management

The app currently uses server-side filesystem sessions through `Flask-Session`. The original document's signed-cookie-only statement is no longer correct.

Important implications:

- session-backed workflow state remains central to detection, export, restore, and temp-file cleanup
- setup/settings also touch session state, though saved configuration is persisted to disk rather than only to session
- containerization must account for writable session storage

Common session values include:

- `results`
- `detections`
- `metadata`
- `tiles`
- `tmpdirname`
- `needs_setup`
- geocoding usage/limit state

### Temp and File Storage

- temporary session directories are created under `webapp/temp/session`
- uploads are written under `uploads/`
- config is persisted under `webapp/config/.env`

### Config Management

`ts_config.py` is now a major part of the app architecture and should be treated as such.

It handles:

- active config path selection
- migration from legacy `.env`
- best-effort locking for config writes
- env backup and rollback
- provider-key validation
- runtime reload after save

### Model Loading

#### YOLOv5

- engines are loaded lazily through `get_engine()`
- current CUDA path in `ts_yolov5.py` uses batch size `8`
- current semaphore count in `ts_yolov5.py` is `8`

#### EfficientNet

- eager initialization is still the default runtime behavior
- lazy initialization exists behind `TOWERSCOUT_LAZY_MODEL_INIT`
- debug-image dumping is gated by `TOWERSCOUT_SAVE_EN_DEBUG_IMAGES`

### Detection Progress

Detection progress is now a first-class runtime feature:

- in-memory tracker in `ts_progress.py`
- progress endpoint in Flask
- frontend polling and stale-terminal-state handling
- explicit cancel-request state

This is important enough to be included in any authoritative context document.

## Map Provider Architecture

### Current Provider Reality

- Google Maps and Azure Maps are the active providers that matter for current user-facing workflows.
- Provider availability is driven by configured keys and surfaced to the UI.
- Default provider ordering is influenced by `DEFAULT_MAP_PROVIDER`.

### Google Maps

Current important state:

- `SearchBox` has been replaced by `PlaceAutocompleteElement`
- Google script loading is dynamic
- custom drawing replaced dependency on deprecated `DrawingManager`
- `google.maps.Marker` deprecation is still active in current Google documentation; `AdvancedMarkerElement` remains the recommended replacement, but Google does not currently list legacy `Marker` as scheduled for discontinuation
- migration to `AdvancedMarkerElement` is still relevant future work, but it should be treated as an informed modernization item rather than an immediate break/fix requirement

### Azure Maps

Current important state:

- Azure uses the Azure Maps Web SDK plus service SDK
- drawing and search integrations are active
- Azure remains a first-class backend and frontend provider

## Frontend Architecture

### Build System

- `webapp/build.js` concatenates frontend source modules into `webapp/js/towerscout.js`
- the source build order currently covers 30 JavaScript modules
- generated output should be treated as build output, not hand-authored source

### Current Source Areas

#### Foundation

- `src/config.js`
- `src/store.js`

#### Managers

- `ProviderStateManager.js`
- `TimerManager.js`
- `EventListenerManager.js`
- `ErrorHandler.js`

#### Boundaries

- `CircleBoundary.js`
- `PolygonBoundary.js`
- `ZipcodeBoundary.js`

#### Providers

- `TSMap_base.js`
- `GoogleMap.js`
- `AzureMap.js`
- `providerInit.js`
- `providerSwitch.js`

#### Detection

- `PlaceRect.js`
- `Detection.js`
- `DetectionList.js`
- `DetectionReview.js`
- `Tile.js`

#### UI and Shared Helpers

- `search.js`
- `export.js`
- `navigation.js`
- `apiHelpers.js`
- `coordinates.js`
- `imagery.js`
- `polygonValidation.js`
- `setup-wizard.js`
- `settings.js`
- `globals.js`
- `towerscout.js`

### Frontend Behaviors That Should Be Preserved

- setup wizard auto-check on startup
- progress overlay and polling behavior
- stale response suppression for cancelled/superseded detection requests
- provider-switch behavior
- manual tower drawing UX
- layered app logging via `TowerScoutLogger`

## Route Surface Worth Knowing

### Utility and Provider Routes

- `GET /getengines`
- `GET /getgooglekey`
- `GET /getproviders`

### Config and Setup Routes

- `POST /api/config/validate-key`
- `POST /api/config/save-keys`
- `GET /api/config/status`
- `POST /api/config/reset-session`
- `GET /api/config/performance`

### Geocoding and Detection Routes

- `POST /api/geocode/forward`
- `POST /api/geocode/reverse`
- `POST /api/detection/estimate`
- `GET /api/detection/progress`
- `POST /getobjects`
- `POST /getobjectscustom`

### Data Management Routes

- `POST /uploaddataset`
- image/model upload routes still exist and should be checked before changing upload behavior

## Development Workflows

### Local Development

```bash
cd webapp
python towerscout.py dev
```

### Frontend Build and Browser Validation

```bash
node webapp/build.js
npm run test:stage-0
npm run test:browser:detect
npm run test:browser:detect:google
npm run test:browser:detect:azure
```

### CI Reality

Current CI includes:

- frontend bundle rebuild and ProviderStateManager regression coverage on Node 18
- Python 3.11 and 3.12
- `flake8`
- `black --check` as non-blocking
- `mypy` as non-blocking
- `bandit` as non-blocking
- unit tests
- integration tests as non-blocking
- Docker image build check on `main` as non-blocking
- Codecov upload as non-blocking
- Trivy security scan and SARIF upload as non-blocking

Node 18 is now end-of-life. Treat migration of the frontend CI/runtime baseline to a supported Node LTS line as CI maintenance work that should be validated against the current build and Puppeteer smoke paths before changing the workflow.

Current CI has per-job timeout limits and pytest timeout safeguards. Route-test imports are isolated from real local `.env`, logs, uploads, sessions, and cache paths through the test bootstrap. Full asset-backed package validation remains manual/advisory unless a later `TASK-067`/`TASK-074` ratchet promotes a bounded package smoke gate.

Do not describe container release validation as fully automated CI coverage yet. CI can attempt to build the image on `main`, and the manual GHCR publish workflow can publish a digest-pinned image, but full asset-backed release validation remains a manual Task-088 closeout step. `TASK-066` validated the digest-pinned Docker Desktop and Podman package-runtime paths, but Podman support language must distinguish package runtime, Docker-Desktop-free Compose-provider coverage, and source-build/base-image TLS behavior.

## Container And Deployment Strategy

### Current Reality

Docker-compatible / OCI containerization is now implemented as the `TASK-025` baseline. The repo includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `compose.build.yaml`, health/readiness endpoints, runtime persistence docs, release package helper scripts, asset import helpers, TLS CA import helpers, and a manual GHCR publish workflow.

The current product direction is:

- use the merged OCI-compatible container contract rather than a Docker Desktop-specific product path
- make GitHub Releases the default user-facing delivery control plane
- preserve the frozen `v0.1.2` Pilot Package's narrower historical support
  wording
- qualify Docker CPU, Docker GPU, Podman CPU, and Podman GPU as equally
  supported final-candidate profiles when documented prerequisites pass
- require Podman to work without Docker Desktop through an approved standalone
  Compose provider selected through `PODMAN_COMPOSE_PROVIDER`
- preserve Docker compatibility where licensing and endpoint policy allow
- keep local source clone/build as a developer/support path, not the preferred normal-user install path
- package normal users through a GitHub Release ZIP with `compose.yaml`, `.env` template, scripts, docs, manifest/checksums, and a pinned GHCR image digest; reserve OCI image archives for restricted-network fallback
- manage large model/data assets through the release asset bundle contract, extracted package-local `assets/` layout, import helper, readiness checks, and manifest hash verification
- preserve the single GPU-capable package direction with CPU-safe default
  launch; GPU profiles still require selected-engine NVIDIA validation and
  readiness `selected_device=cuda`
- clarify TowerScout's application license suitability separately from runtime-tooling choice

### Post-TASK-025 Guardrails

The merged container baseline must preserve:

- writable filesystem-backed session storage
- stable `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
- persistent writable config storage for `webapp/config/`
- awareness that setup/settings persist configuration to disk, not just in memory
- `/api/health` and structured `/api/readiness` states for launcher and support use

Without those constraints, first-launch setup may fail or saved configuration may be lost when the container is replaced.

## File Structure Conventions

- `ts_*.py` backend module naming remains conventional in `webapp/`
- `model_params/` contains model weights and is excluded from git
- `uploads/` is temporary user-file storage
- `templates/` contains Jinja templates
- `.agent_work/` holds planning, documentation, decisions, and context

## Work Planning and Documentation Guidance

The original document carried substantial workflow guidance. Much of that remains useful if rephrased as current project preference rather than rigid agent protocol.

### Request Classification

#### Type A

- quick fixes
- small documentation changes
- low-risk config or validation adjustments
- usually no heavy design artifact overhead

#### Type B

- user-facing feature work
- UI/UX changes
- new endpoint or workflow additions
- should usually sync task/design context when the change is non-trivial

#### Type C

- architecture changes
- security-sensitive work
- major performance work
- deployment and infrastructure shifts
- should include explicit impact analysis and stronger documentation discipline

### Task Tracking Expectations

Current preferred project artifacts:

- `.agent_work/current-tasks.md` for active work
- `.agent_work/task-backlog.md` for future work
- `.agent_work/completed-tasks.md` for recent completions
- `.agent_work/requirements.md`
- `.agent_work/design.md`
- current sprint task files under `.agent_work/tasks/active/`
- prior-sprint task files under `.agent_work/tasks/completed/`

`.github/instructions/spec-driven-approach.instructions.md` is the authoritative source for `.agent_work` organization rules.

### Workspace Context Layout

- `.agent_work/context/guides/`
- `.agent_work/context/analysis/`
- `.agent_work/context/status/`
- `.agent_work/context/archive/`
- `.agent_work/decisions/`
- `.agent_work/tmp/` and `.agent_work/pytest-temp/` as scratch-only surfaces

## Project-Specific Guardrails

### ML and Detection Guardrails

- preserve detection behavior unless the user explicitly asks to change it
- be cautious in `ts_yolov5.py` and `ts_en.py`
- preserve export/restore semantics, especially manual-tower provenance
- preserve geographic accuracy and coordinate precision

### Setup and Deployment Guardrails

- do not describe setup/settings as future work
- do not ignore filesystem-session implications in deployment work
- do not treat config persistence as only a documentation concern; it is an active runtime requirement
- before runtime-dependent work, tell the user whether Docker Desktop, Podman,
  or both are required and ask them to start the runtime
- wait for confirmation before runtime validation because Docker Desktop may
  require a workstation restart
- planning, documentation, and static source review do not require runtime
  startup

### Legacy Feature Preservation

- outbreak investigation workflows remain the priority preservation surface
- registry/labeling workflows remain important
- provider-specific UX differences should be preserved unless intentionally redesigned

## Git Workflow and Change Hygiene

The original document contained useful Git guidance. The following remains a reasonable project preference:

### Branching

- use feature/fix/docs/refactor style branch names when preparing reviewable work
- `main` is the only long-lived integration branch
- start new work from the latest `main`
- open PRs against `main` by default
- use stacked PRs only when a child branch has a real dependency on unmerged parent work
- see `.github/instructions/github-repo-management.instructions.md` for the standing repo workflow policy

### Commits

- prefer clear conventional-commit-style messages
- keep a readable paper trail for architecture or workflow changes
- make intentional commit checkpoints when a bounded slice of work is complete
- make a commit checkpoint before switching tasks or starting a risky refactor
- agents should proactively remind the user when current work looks commit-ready or branch-ready

### PR-Level Documentation Expectations

For substantial work, it is useful to preserve:

- executive summary
- impact assessment
- validation evidence
- note on ML/detection safety when relevant
- links to task or decision artifacts when architecture changes are involved

## Coding and Quality Guidelines

### Security First

- never introduce hardcoded secrets
- keep validation in place for user input and uploads
- preserve sanitized logging behavior

### Code Quality

- prefer explicit, testable code paths
- keep backend exceptions structured
- preserve current validation and rate-limiting surfaces
- avoid unnecessary complexity in legacy-critical workflows

### Performance

- respect current performance-sensitive paths in detection, provider overlays, and geocoding
- be careful with any work that affects under-100-tile investigation speed
- keep CPU-only deployment needs in mind for future work

## Work Completed Recently

The original guidance benefited from explicitly naming recent completed work. That remains useful for agent context.

### Completed or Landed in Recent Sprints

- API key migration to environment/config handling
- setup wizard and settings implementation
- config validation and persistence flow
- detection progress tracking and cancel lifecycle
- Google Maps API migration to modern search/drawing approach
- frontend modularization and build system
- manual tower workflow restoration and export provenance improvements
- console log gating and layered in-app logging
- large-dataset performance investigation and quick wins
- detection workflow stabilization with live browser validation

## Current Path Forward

### Fix-First Priority Sequence

1. Keep `v0.1.2` immutable as the Pilot Package.
2. Task-095 Phase A, Task-090, and Task-098 are complete.
3. Preserve completed Task-099 evidence for the August Dependabot alerts and
   later js-yaml npm audit finding, including the eight documented
   non-blocking torch residuals and qualified ML pair.
4. Complete active Task-101's focused Node/Puppeteer remediation and
   compatibility matrix; do not weaken or dismiss the blocking audit.
5. Keep PR #67 open for reviewer input, then bring the accepted Task-101 change
   into it and resume Task-087 only after the gate passes.
6. Complete Task-087 implementation and validation; keep signing and candidate
   inclusion behind Task-087's remaining qualification gates.
7. Complete Task-096 Exit/Stop and Task-097 Podman CPU/GPU qualification.
8. Qualify Docker CPU/GPU and Podman CPU/GPU.
9. Start Task-058 early only when all required gates, including Task-101,
   pass; keep Task-059 behind
   Task-058 acceptance and schedule margin.
10. Complete owner-runnable qualification, documentation, recovery, governance,
   and handoff work.
11. Select the official cdcai identity, build it consistently, and execute
   Task-089 only after owner approval.

### Practical Agent Takeaway

An agent should leave with the following understanding:

- the app is no longer missing setup/settings
- the repo has a merged Docker-compatible / OCI container baseline and local launcher MVP
- the release path uses a digest-pinned GHCR image and package-local asset import flow
- `v0.1.2` remains immutable while new work uses `v0.1.3-rc.N` candidates
- Docker CPU/GPU and Podman CPU/GPU are required final-candidate profiles
- local/CI pytest timeout safeguards and Flask route-test isolation are merged through `TASK-067`
- the non-mutating Task-087 Gate 3 proof is merged and the Tasks 090/098/099
  scoped dependency-security gates passed, but newly disclosed alert `#76` is
  owned by active Task-101 and pauses Task-087 implementation/merge/publication
- PR #67 remains open for reviewer input while Task-101 is active
- filesystem sessions and disk-backed config writes are real architectural constraints
- Google and Azure workflows are both important
- outbreak-investigation workflows are the highest-value legacy surface to preserve
- Tasks 090, 098, and 099 remain complete; Task-099 owns the August dependency
  disclosure evidence without reopening the earlier historical records
- Task-101 uniquely owns alert `#76`; do not rewrite Task-099's dated closeout
- Task-089 execution remains blocked until final qualification and explicit
  cdcai-owner adoption approval
